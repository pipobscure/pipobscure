*Question: *Hi, How did you start the Diet? Did you fast? How long did it took you to see results?

*Answer: *Well I started motivated ;)

The first thing I did was read [The Art Science Carbohydrate Living](http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Science-Carbohydrate-Living/dp/0983490708) which gave me a start at the scientific underpinnings which is important because you want to understand what you are doing and what to watch out for.

The second thing I did was schedule an appointment with my doctor to discuss the project with her. This ended up with me getting a full blood work-up as well as a full EKG to establish a baseline.

As for what to eat, I basically followed an Atkins Diet. Just google and you will find all the details you could want.

I also knew that the bathroom scale is a horrible liar. To begin with you body-weight fluctuates ±1kg to begin with. And most bathroom scales have their own inaccuracy. So getting on a scale is something that I decided to avoid. \*\*Pro-Tip: Avoid the measure everything craze. It will not tell you what you want to know\*\*.

What I did do is go in for a check-up every 2 months, again doing a full blood work-up and EKG as well as actually weighing. So yes, I did actually observe closely what was going on, but by not measuring everything thrice a day, I avoided demotivating myself.

So to answer the second part of your question, I don’t know how long it took for something to happen. I just started noticing that my pants began to fall down, that my belt ran out of loops and so on. But it took time. For the major part of my weight-loss it to be over it took pretty close to 6 months. In that time I weighed in 3 times.

I hope this helps. Of course people are different. Some people are motivated by numbers and can ignore them well when they go the wrong way, or don’t go down quick enough for their master plan. I for my part am easily demotivated by slacking or negative trends, so avoiding continuous measurement but closely monitoring, helped me out.

Oh and one important thing: \*This is not something you should do to loose weight and when you reached your goal you go back to eating carbs as before. \*\*This is a lifestyle change!\*\* \*
