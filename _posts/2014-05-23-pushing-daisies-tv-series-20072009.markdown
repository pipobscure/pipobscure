[Pushing Daisies (TV Series 2007–2009)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0925266/)

> Created by Bryan Fuller. With Lee Pace, Anna Friel, Chi McBride, Jim Dale. A pie-maker, with the power to bring dead people back to life, solves murder mysteries with his alive-again childhood sweetheart, a cynical private investigator, and a lovesick waitress.

I am in the middle of the second season and it’s amazingly incredibly great!
