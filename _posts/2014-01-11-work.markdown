If you follow the socialist ideal, each day consists of 3 segments with 8hours each.

*   8hours work
*   8hours leisure
*   8hours sleep

That in turn means that you spend ½ your wake hours at work. And that’s if you are living the socialist ideal. in reality it’s likely more.

So if you do something for half your waking hours or more, it better be something you enjoy doing. That’s been my philosophy and it’s why I have turned my passion into my work. the only problem is that I now come off as a workoholic, when in reality I’m a funoholic.
