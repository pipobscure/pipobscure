[Want To Remember Something? Then Don't Snap a Photo](http://fastcompany.com/3023316/leadership-now/want-to-remember-something-then-dont-snap-a-photo)

I guess if you snap a photo, you remember you have forgotten when you see the picture. While if you don’t take a photo, there is nothing to remind you you have forgotten, so you think you remember more when in reality you just don’t remember what you forgot because you don’t have a photo.

And you thought Einsteins theory of relativity was hard :)
