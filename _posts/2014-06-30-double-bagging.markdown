# Double Bagging

Ok, so I understand that 1 thin as shit bag is cheaper than 1 thicker bag. But when you then double bag everything because the bag is so thin it rips, you got 2 thin bags to 1 thicker. And all you savings are gone.

Can someone please explain to me the sense in those stupid thin bags?
