It is evident that rape-culture is a thing and we have come to accept that #NotAllMen is just a feeble excuse for silently accepting and promoting it.

And then there is an act of religiously motivated terror like that in Paris. The first commentary that I heard after the report was “Not All Muslims” are violent retrogrades. You know what: IT’S THE SAME LAME EXCUSE

And I’m having none of it. I know that not all men are rapists, not all Muslims are terrorists and not all religions call for the unconditional annihilation of unbelievers. But I don’t care. My tolerance is at its end.

I refuse to make concessions for people peddling non-sense. If you want to pray in your own home and believe in bollocks of any kind, be my guest. That’s your thing. But when you enter the public sphere your superstitions have no place.

And just in case you were wondering: I’m not islamophobic I’m islamomisic. (and christomisic, and religiomisic for that matter)
