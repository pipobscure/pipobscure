# Ethics

It is impossible to have a rigorous ethical justification for anything if you believe in a god. That is because the fact you believe in god will automatically be a shortcut to “because god said so”. In order to go the distance and have a valid ethical justification you need to completely rid yourself of any remnant of god.
