> A reminder to all who haven’t heard: **THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS WILL RIDE AGAIN…_FUELED BY NETFLIX_…IN 2016.**
> 
> **You read that right.** Through [Netflix’s](http://mashable.com/category/netflix/) acquisition of [Scholastic](http://www.scholastic.com/home/), a **26-episode series will kick off in 2016, called _The Magic School Bus 360°_.**
> 
> From the announcement [via Mashable](http://mashable.com/2014/06/11/magic-school-bus-netflix/):
> 
> > Netflix and Scholastic Media announced in a press statement that **the new series will use CGI animation to feature a “_modernized Ms. Frizzle_“ and an ”_inventive high-tech bus_”** — so it looks like the companies are not afraid to take chances and make mistakes (and probably get messy in the process). The very 21st-century show **will also focus on modern tech innovations, including robotics and wearables.**
> > 
> > **“_The all-new episodes also leverage advancements in animation, science and technology in a way that will delight a new generation of young viewers, and like its predecessor, will help kids around the world discover the magic and value of exploration and innovation,_”** a press statement reads.

> > The Magic School Bus is **the longest-running kids’ science series in history, first airing on PBS in 1994 and continuing in syndication for 18 consecutive years. It has even earned an Emmy Award.** (Undoubtedly for Liz the Lizard’s acting.)
> > 
> > **“_Magic School Bus, the old version, is remarkably popular on Netflix,_”** Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer [told The New York Times.](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/11/business/media/netflix-orders-new-childrens-show-based-on-magic-school-bus.html?_r=1) **“_It teaches science in a way that transcends generations._”**
> > 
> > Scholastic Media has not yet announced if the original Ms. Frizzle, Lily Tomlin, will return to voice the character.
> 
> And from a similar announcement [via CNN](http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/11/news/companies/netflix-magic-school-bus/):
> 
> > **“_To do an animated show that has actually encouraged young people to pursue careers in the sciences or teaching makes us very, very happy._”**
