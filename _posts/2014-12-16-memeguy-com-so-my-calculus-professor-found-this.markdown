This is actually a perfect example because once you realise that the triangle, the car, the carâ€™s speed and win resistance are irrelevant to the question it becomes really easy.

The question is: how many cupcakes can one buy with 1 human soul.  
The answer is: None, because the human soul does not exist, and if it did it would not have monetary value and thus could not be used to purchase cupcakes.

Told You! EASY!
