I just dropped half our household at household (due to the move) at the local women’s shelter.

\* 1 box of DVDs  
\* 1 box of Books  
\* 1 box of Womens Clothing  
\* 1 box of Childrens clothing  
\* 2 boxes of Toys  
\* 1 box of Food (Rice, Pasta, Beans, …)

It made me feel acutely uncomfortable, because I felt the intense feeling of dislike rolling of these women mixed with fear and chuzpa and…

I watched these three slight women wrestle with these heavy and huge boxes that I had trouble with when loading. They seemed like the ant carrying the apple in the cartoons, except without any of the grace of the ant.

Suppressing my instinct to just pick up a box and carry it in I found it a challenge to accept that I was not welcome in their lair. Yet the fact that such places are needed is made abundantly clear by the radiating suspicion of these women.

This is likely the only situation I have actually experienced where I could glimpse what any minority experiences full force: the combination of overt welcome and covert distrust and dislike.

So while I would discourage white males to go around the local women’s shelter for the experience, if you ever get the chance then pay attention to all the subliminal things going on. It can be a learning experience.
