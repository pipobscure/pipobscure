High immunization rates protect vulnerable individuals (who can’t be vaccinated due to medical problems or because they’re too young) because everybody else is vaccinated. When significant numbers of unimmunized individuals cluster, [herd immunity](http://www.vaccines.gov/basics/protection/) is lost.

Unimmunized children acquired measles during this outbreak.

Other symptoms include fever, cough, and a runny nose. In those days, measles sometimes killed or caused eye damage — it still does in developing parts of the world with inadequate vaccination programs. Routine measles vaccines in the 1960s ended that threat in the U.S. — until perhaps now.

(As a child of the 1960s, I can assure you that I and my four siblings all survived measles, mumps, German measles, and chickenpox - without even a visit to the doctor. AS DID MOST CHILDREN!) Children in developing parts of the world are at risk because **they lack the basic necessities of healthy living**: sanitation, nutrition, education, protection from the elements.

Let’s stop this crappy meme if “parents are uniquely qualified to sense real threats to their children”. I’m a parent and I know for a fact that that makes me no more qualified to sense a real threat to my children than anyone else. What makes one “uniquely qualified to sense a threat to children” is actual education and study; nothing else.

So let’s get a new and truer meme: “Parents that object to vaccinations despite overwhelming evidence to their safety and efficacy are uniquely unqualified to protect their children and present a clear and present danger to all children”
