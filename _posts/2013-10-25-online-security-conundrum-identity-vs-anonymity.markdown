[Online Security Conundrum: Identity vs. Anonymity](http://www.youtube.com/attribution\_link?a=0ocHzq6joUQhF4WkVyk-\_w&u=/watch?v=\_DCkVxHZWDY&feature=share)

Matt Honan hosts a discussion between Jeff Jarvis (Professor of Journalism) and Chris Paul (Founder of 4Chan).

Very interesting discussion, what they are missing though is Â a very important distinction:

*   **Anonymous** - bearing no naming element
*   **Pseudonomous** - bearing a non-canonical name  
    
*   **Identified** - bearing a canonical name

The difference between pseudonymous and anonymous is very important, because pseudonymity provides many of the benefits of identity while still providing many of the advantages of anonymity.

Well worth the half hour it takes.
