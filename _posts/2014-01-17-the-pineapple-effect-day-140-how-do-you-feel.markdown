> **Day 140:** how do you feel about people disrespecting their parents?  
> I feel like a lot of people don’t appreciate their parents enough, but there are definitely some parents who treat their kids like shit and don’t deserve any respect. I feel really bad for people who still respect (or try to respect) their abusive parents.

You should become a politician. This was a perfect politician answer:

1.  Repeat the statement of the question (there are people disrespecting their parents)
2.  Switch topics by making a loosley related statement (some parents abuse their kids)
3.  Give a quanswer (question framed as an answer) about your own statement (I don’t get kids respecting their abusive parents)

And presto, question has been evaded without an answer. However, since you are not in a political forum, here you can be called on it. So start again:

_How do you feel about people disrespecting their parents?_
