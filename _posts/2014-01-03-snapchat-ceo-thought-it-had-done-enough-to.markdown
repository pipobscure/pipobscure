[Snapchat CEO Thought It Had ‘Done Enough’ To Protect Against Hack, Won’t Apologize](http://news.yahoo.com/snapchat-ceo-thought-had-done-enough-protect-against-155521500.html)

> Following a massive security breach that exposed the private information of millions of Snapchat users, CEO Evan Spiegel finally spoke out publicly on NBC’s Today this morning. In the “exclusive interview,” conducted by star tech reporter Carson Daly, Mr. Spiegel said that despite prior warnings from a security company that its users’ information was vulnerable to a hack, he believed the company did enough to protect it users. Apparently “enough” has a fuzzy definition since hackers were able to expose the usernames and phone numbers using the app’s “Find Friends” feature on New Year’s Eve. 

Well there is one bugger that should be dismissed by his company’s owners. Bad enough he fucked up, he doesn’t even get that he did.
