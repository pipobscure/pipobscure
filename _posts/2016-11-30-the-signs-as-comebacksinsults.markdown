# The signs as comebacks/insults

[astr-odiac](http://astr-odiac.tumblr.com/post/153793671623/the-signs-as-comebacksinsults):

> Aries : Remember that time I said I thought you were cool? I lied.
> 
> Taurus : You only annoy me when you’re breathing, really.
> 
> Gemini : Do yourself a favor and ignore anyone who tells you to be yourself. Bad idea in your case.
> 
> Cancer: Everyone’s entitled to act stupid once in awhile, but you really abuse the privilege.
> 
> Leo : Sometimes it’s better to keep your mouth shut and give the impression that you’re stupid than open it and remove all doubt.
> 
> Virgo: Remember when I asked for your opinion? Me neither.
> 
> Libra : Do your parents even realize they’re living proof that two wrongs don’t make a right?
> 
> Scorpio : Do you ever wonder what life would be like if you’d gotten enough oxygen at birth?
> 
> Sagittarius : Are you always such an idiot, or do you just show off when I’m around?
> 
> Capricorn : There are some remarkably dumb people in this world. Thanks for helping me understand that.
> 
> Aquarius: I could eat a bowl of alphabet soup and shit out a smarter statement than whatever you just said.
> 
> Pisces : Some day you’ll go far—and I really hope you stay there.
