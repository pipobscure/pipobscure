Today is “Holocaust Remembrance Day” a day in the year dedicated to remembering the evil humanity is capable of.

Between 1933 and 1945 Nazi Germany managed to murder more than 6 million people whose only crime was to be Jewish or Roma or gay or otherwise “undesirable”.

Lest we believe that this is just history let’s examine our world today and see if there be anti-semitism, racism and hatred in it. We owe it to those who perished to do so in their name and remember!
