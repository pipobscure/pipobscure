[My Husband Doesn't Need to See Your Boobs](http://applesandbandaidsblog.com/2014/06/11/my-husband-doesnt-need-to-see-your-boobs/)

This is likely the stupidest thing I have read in a while. If that woman is so insecure about herself and her relationship, that she feels threatened by social-media pictures of women living their lives including hanging out at the beach; well guess what her problem is not the women at the beach, itâ€™s her insecurity and self doubt.

Yet her fears are real. She should definitely seek professional help rather than trying to curb other peoples joy in life.
