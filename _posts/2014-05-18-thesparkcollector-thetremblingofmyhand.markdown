Very few religions include values based on hatred and violence. Religion doesn’t start wars or kill children, people do.

When you’ve spent your whole life being told that something (blood transfusions, for example) will damn you to eternal darkness, it becomes out of your reach to simply stop believing it.

No actually religions are inherently dangerous. Freedom of religion needs to have much stricter limits.

As an adult I can drink, but when I do I am not allowed to drive because it endangers others.

As an adult I can believe, but when I do I should not be allowed to make decisions that affect others lives.
