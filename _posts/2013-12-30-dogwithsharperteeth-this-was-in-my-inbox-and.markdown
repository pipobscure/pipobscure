**Death Announcement**

Dr. Sigmund Suitzer, royal empirial judicial councilor, and Mrs. Therese Blum announce in their own name as well as those of all nieces and neffews in deepest sorrow the news of the death of his beloved sister (and aunt)

**Babette Beer**  
_widow of a royal empirial professor and gubernatorial councilor_

who on Friday the 27th of February 1885 at 3 o’clock in the afternoon after lengthy suffering in her 75th year slipped from life into eternal peace. The funeral will take place on Sunday the 1st of March in the morning at half past 9 at the mourning house at Pillersdorfgasse 6 (11th district), just past the central cemetery (Israelite section).

_this is instead of distinct personal notification_

And yes the whole thing is basically one single sentence with innumerable sub-clauses. But it’s gorgeous.

P.S.: royal and empirial whatever is an honorary title achieved by doing any job long enough, and not an actual role.

P.P.S.: these people obviously lived in Vienna, Austria at a time before WWI when antisemitism was less pronounced than at any later time.
