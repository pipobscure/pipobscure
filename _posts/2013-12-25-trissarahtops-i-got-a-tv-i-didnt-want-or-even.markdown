> I got a tv I didn’t want or even remotely ask for a blue ray player I can’t use because I don’t own any DVDs or blue rays or have funds to buy any, slippers that are two small and a immersion blender ( something I already own). I know I sound like a spoiled brat but it bugs me every year that I can recall my brothers always bested me with gifts from the parents. Just give me cash already.

Isn’t there this christmas-gift-recycling-website? I think it’s called ebay
