> I follow a few people who do keto and I like their blogs and stuff but PLEASE do not ever do keto I mean it sounds like common sense that a 60% fat diet would be bad for you but there r people out here eating straight sticks of butter and cups of coconut oil. like u will lose weight initially…

Never frame your arguments in terms of common sense. Rather do some actual research. After that, come back and we can chat about what you found.

For starters you could have a look at [http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0983490708](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0983490708) which should give you a base.

Do yourself a favor and don’t pit your common sense against actual research and education. You’ll just look silly.
