when Carl von Clausewitz (1780-1831) said:

> War is the continuation of politics by other means.

I always thought he was being callous about war. Being a Prussian general that assumption is reasonable.

Looking at politics today though I have realised that maybe he was simply saying:

> Politics is just as stupid as war but you donâ€™t get quite as bloody.

Or maybe elections in Austria are just depressing.
