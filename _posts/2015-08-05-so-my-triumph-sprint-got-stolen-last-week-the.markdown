So my Triumph Sprint got stolen last week. The thieves did get caught when they were involved in an accident this Monday. Thatâ€™s all the excuse I needed to buy this beauty. A Royal Enfield Bullet 350. So all in all Iâ€™m a happy camper ðŸ˜€

More importantly though, I want to get a report about my interaction with British police on record. I have dealt with police in several countries, among them the US, Germany and Austria. Never have I had an experience like this.

I reported my bike stolen by phone and asked whether I should come down to the station. The refused and instead two officers came by my house to look at the crime scene and take my report. Without even asking, they gave me a card, with their names and badge numbers as well as a reference number for the case and a phone number if I had any questions.

On Monday afternoon, police from another borough called me up and told me my bike had been found after being involved in an accident. They offered to stay around for an hour so I could go and pick it up since otherwise theyâ€™d have to tow it to the pound which would cost me a lot of money. Of course I took them up on their offer. They asked me for a further statement and helped me find a garage to bring my bike to as it was not road worthy.

Again I got a card with the officers details and so on. Today I received a letter with an update on the case.

I have to say, they were courteous and professional all the way. It was a real pleasure dealing with them. So I have to say, Britain had this whole policing thing done right. So dear Metropolitan Police force you have my gratitude and respect. You are by far the best in policing I have so far experienced.
