Unplugging from devices doesn’t stop us from experiencing our lives through their lenses, frames, and formats. We are only ever tourists in the land of no technology, our visas valid for a day or a week or a year, and we travel there with the same eyes and ears that we use in our digital homeland.

Casey N. Cep on [The pointlessness of unplugging](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2014/03/the-pointlessness-of-unplugging.html) (via [thisistheverge](http://thisistheverge.tumblr.com/))

This is a worthwhile read. I’ll have to forward it to a couple of people.
