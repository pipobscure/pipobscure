> Dear Cutie-Pie,
> 
> Recently, your mother and I were searching for an answer on Google. Halfway through entering the question, Google returned a list of the most popular searches in the world. Perched at the top of the list was “How to keep him interested.”
> 
> It startled me. I scanned several of the countless articles about how to be sexy and sexual, when to bring him a beer versus a sandwich, and the ways to make him feel smart and superior.
> 
> And I got _angry_.
> 
> **Little One, it _is_ not, has never _been_, and never _will_ be your job to “keep him interested.”**
> 
> Little One, your only task is to know deeply in your soul—in that unshakeable place that isn’t rattled by rejection and loss and ego—that you are _worthy_ of interest. (If you can remember that everyone _else_ is worthy of interest also, the battle of your life will be mostly won. But that is a letter for another day.)
> 
> If you can trust your worth in this way, you will be attractive in the most important sense of the word: you will attract a boy who is both _capable_ of interest and who wants to spend his one life investing all of his interest in _you_.
> 
> **Little One, I want to tell you about the boy who doesn’t need to be _kept_interested, because he knows you _are interesting:_**
> 
> I don’t care if he puts his elbows on the dinner table—as long as he puts his eyes on the way your nose scrunches when you smile. And then can’t stop looking.
> 
> I don’t care if he can’t play a bit of golf with me—as long as he can play with the children you give him and revel in all the glorious and frustrating ways they are just like you.
> 
> I don’t care if he doesn’t follow his wallet—as long as he follows his _heart_ and it always leads him back to you.
> 
> I don’t care if he is strong—as long as he gives you the space to exercise the strength that is in _your_ heart.
> 
> I couldn’t care less how he votes—as long as he wakes up every morning and daily elects you to a place of honor in your home and a place of reverence in _his_ heart.
> 
> I don’t care about the color of his skin—as long as he paints the canvas of your lives with brushstrokes of patience, and sacrifice, and vulnerability, and tenderness.
> 
> I don’t care if he was raised in _this_ religion or _that_ religion or _no_ religion—as long as he was raised to value the sacred and to know every moment of life, and every moment of life with you, is _deeply_ sacred.
> 
> In the end, Little One, if you stumble across a man like that and he and I have nothing else in common, we will have the _most important_ thing in common:
> 
> _You._
> 
> **Because in the end, Little One, the only thing you should have to do to “keep him interested” is to be _you_.**
> 
> Your eternally interested guy,
> 
> Daddy
