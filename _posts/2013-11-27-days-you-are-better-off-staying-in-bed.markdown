# Days you are better off staying in bed

yesterday was definitely one of those. First a totally unproductive day where the height of achievement was checking on other peoples work. Then a tough evening meeting until like 5:30

As if that were not enough, and I not down enough, I go by Starbucks on my way to the station, and they totally mess up my (espresso doppio con panna) by just adding extra milk. Like what’s with that?

At the station I decided to drop by McDonalds for some salad and again they mess up the order (Greek salad instead of Italian).

Then after that, and just reaching the train, it’s delayed at the next stop.

It’s obvious that the world has to be in a conspiracy against me. How can they torment me so? I mean these are serious attacks on my person how come this is not front-page news?

After all news shouldn’t be the exclusive property of [dumb people that can’t spell for sh\*\*](http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/oddnews/driver-offended-by-%E2%80%9Cwh0-r8x%E2%80%9D-license-plate-221720503.html).

Come on they are complaining about being offended by a license plate, while people are going thirsty and hungry here. That’s just obnoxious.
