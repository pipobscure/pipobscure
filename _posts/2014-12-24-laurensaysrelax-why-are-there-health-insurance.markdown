For me it’s Netflix with some Hose(man)shit cartoon. It’s annoying, but they have to make money somehow. I just wish there was a way to say “dear Tumblr with this add you have it wrong” to switch things up. As it stands, the add makes me think more of cancelling Netflix for doing such a crap show than of buying an upgraded subscription.
