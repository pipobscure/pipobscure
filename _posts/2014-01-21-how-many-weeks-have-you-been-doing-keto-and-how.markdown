*Question: *How many weeks have you been doing keto and how many pounds have you lost so far? Would you recommend it to someone wanting to drop 30lbs in 3 months?

*Answer: *8 weeks & I’ve dropped 24lbs!  
It’s different for everyone! Don’t go into it expecting to have the same loss as me, my body went into shock I think & I’m really anal about it as well!  
I never go over my carb limit!
