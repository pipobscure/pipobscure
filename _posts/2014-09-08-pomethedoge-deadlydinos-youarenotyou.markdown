title: Why is there the assumption that I tried to get out of the “friendzone”?
  Maybe that compliment was just stating a truth that I felt might brighten the
  shitty day I saw all over her face and “aw thanks” was already more of an
  overt reaction than I expected for a simple “I liked that presentation. The
  hard work you put in was worth it.”

Why is there the assumption that I tried to get out of the “friendzone”? Maybe that compliment was just stating a truth that I felt might brighten the shitty day I saw all over her face and “aw thanks” was already more of an overt reaction than I expected for a simple “I liked that presentation. The hard work you put in was worth it.”
