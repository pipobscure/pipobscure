I love colourful mental images. Especially when they make unwitting statements about the speaker like Nr.3

With magnetism like poles repulse, so if he likened looks to magnetism he also made a statement about himself.

But I think he was onto something. If beauty were like magnetism, then would that not mean it depends entirely on the observer?

Keep thinking about it and you might come to a place where beauty is not at all objective, but simply a reflection of an observers needs. Which in turn explains why unless you realise that beauty is subjective, you will never like your own.

After all, you are repulsed by like poles.
