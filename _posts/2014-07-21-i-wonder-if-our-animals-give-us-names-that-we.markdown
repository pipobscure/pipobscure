That’s actually an interesting question. I mean when you call your dog by its name, it has learned that specific sound is something you make only when you want it to come. It doesn’t really understand “oh that’s my name, an appellation my human uses to describe me to others as well as address me in speech”.

Now dogs bark, we just rarely pay attention to the nuances of barking; cats meow, we just rarely pay attention to the nuances of meowing.

What if they actually make slightly different sounds depending on who they want an action from?

_Note to self: in next life study animal behaviour and investigate this fully_
