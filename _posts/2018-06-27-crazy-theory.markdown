Crazy Theory
============

Tories are the party of business. British business are shorting now. When Britain suffers they massively buy public assets on the cheap with the gains from shorting. When people suffer, we’ll all gladly rejoin the EU and we’re back where we were. Except that the Tories have succeeded in privatising everything (think NHS, police, roads, DWP admin, …)

  

Sounds crazy? Well it’s the only rational explanation for still wanting Brexit. If that’s crazy, then that is the appropriate adjective.
