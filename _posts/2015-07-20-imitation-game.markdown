Just watched “Imitation Game”. Beside the fact that Benedict Cumberbatch did a marvellous job, I am left feeling incredibly sad that we bereft ourselves of a brilliant mind like Turing’s. The writing at the end hit a nerve “2013 Queen Elisabeth posthumously pardoned him”? What exactly was there to pardon? She should have posthumously apologised to him and asked his pardon instead.
