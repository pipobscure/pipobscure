> On a lighter note (pardon the pun), I had a couple of friends over for dinner and decided to prep a ‘make your own salad’ bar.
> 
> I cooked chicken and bacon pieces and put everything else out and we all built our own.
> 
> Mine, pictured is lettuce, chicken, bacon, Parmesan, bocconcini, avocado, olives and ceasar salad dressing.
> 
> Day 5 keto success!
