One billion people are malnourished while one-third of the world’s arable land is devoted to the production of feed crops for livestock.

[20 True Costs of Factory Pig Farming](http://www.pigbusiness.co.uk/issues/20-facts/)

(and lets not forget that the amount we grow is sufficient to feed those one billion people _and then some_) 

(via [delices-detre-vegetalien](http://delices-detre-vegetalien.tumblr.com/))

This creates the appearance that if we were to stop farming animals, then those _one billon people_ would have food and not be malnourished. That is pure fantasy; Human beings are not fair; if we stopped animal farming, the western world will come up with other uses for arable land and the crops grown there; anything to prevent feeding the malnourished; they’d come up with inventions like fuelling vehicles with crops before even giving the possibility of feeding the world a single thought.

I for one will stick with eating meat.
