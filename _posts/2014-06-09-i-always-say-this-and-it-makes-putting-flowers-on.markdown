I always say this. And it makes putting flowers on my grave much easier: all you need to do is throw out the flowers on the table every week and that’s covered. I’d get regular visits too. So all in all, the bin seems like a perfectly timesaver for my relatives, and honestly: I’m dead so I really won’t care.
