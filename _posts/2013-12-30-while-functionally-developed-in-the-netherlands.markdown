While functionally developed in the Netherlands, the most iconic boomboxes were created in Japan during the 1970s and ’80s. This was a time when Japanese design and manufacturing was evolving from a copying culture to an innovating culture, and the boombox is a great example of this. I want to find the inventors of these important “grail” boxes and tell the stories of how they designed the machines we love, before it’s too late.

**“machines we love”?** maybe I’m becoming an old curmudgeon, but until people develop a taste for music (i.e. adopt mine 😉 ) I’d rather they listen to their music with headphones. So Boom-Boxes are definitely **not machines I love!**
