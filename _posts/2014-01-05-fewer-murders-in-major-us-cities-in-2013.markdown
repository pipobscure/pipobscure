[Fewer murders in major U.S. cities in 2013](http://news.yahoo.com/fewer-murders-major-american-cities-2013-210826237.html)

Well it’s probably just an anomaly, like probably tranquillisers in the water-supply. As soon as that’s over we’ll go back to killing each other again.

Or maybe, just maybe we are slowly coming to our senses. Now if we can only get New Yorkers to kill roughly 333 fewer people…
