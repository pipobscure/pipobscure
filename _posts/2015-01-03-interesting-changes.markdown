I’ve just spent almost two weeks in Austria with family. While I’ve thoroughly enjoyed it it, I’m ready to go home now.

Interesting thing about that is that when I was thinking about “going home” I was for the first time thinking of London.

Since moving to London last summer it has indeed become home. Even more it has become a home that I want to go back to.
