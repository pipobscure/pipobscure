# Definition of a Blog

Here is some I read

*   fitblr
*   healthblr
*   sexblr
*   kidblr
*   funblr
*   foodblr
    
    WTF?
    

How about **lifeblr**? It contains all of the above:

I want to keep fit and healthy, have sex, have kids love fun, cook food …

So if you see something you don’t expect, well good, that’s life! If you like it, well good, that’s life! If you don’t like it, then well tough, that’s life too.

How about not playing the label game, it’s kind of silly.
