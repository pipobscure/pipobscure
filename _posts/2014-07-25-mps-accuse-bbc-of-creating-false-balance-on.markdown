[MPs accuse BBC of creating 'false balance' on climate change with unqualified sceptics](http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/mps-accuse-bbc-of-creating-false-balance-on-climate-change-with-unqualified-sceptics-9231176.html)

> The BBC has been accused of misleading the public about climate change, creating a “false balance” by allowing unqualified climate sceptics too much air time and giving opinion the same weight as fact.

And it now seems as though the BBC has decided that the complaint is valid and it will in future go for a more proportional air-time allotment. Have a look at the beginning of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6Bw9W953nA) for a bit of an explanation on the decision.
