> Steve Sammartino and Raul Oaida built a functional car out of Lego bricks that runs on air. The car is the product of the duo’s Super Awesome Micro Project, a crowd-funded effort that allowed them to take 500,000 Lego bricks and 256 pistons and design a hot rod-esque masterpiece. The car, from engine to seats, is made completely from the tiny bricks, with the exception of a few structural parts including wheels, tires, and gauges. Sammartino and Oaida estimate they’ve dropped $60,000 on Lego bricks alone.
