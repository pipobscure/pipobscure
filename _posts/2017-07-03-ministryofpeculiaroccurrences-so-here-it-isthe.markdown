Noooooo!

I want there to always be another Books & Braun episode in the future. It’s like now I can’t buy this one, so that I’ll have one available in an hour of need.

At least tell us you aren’t killing off Eliza or Wellington so that there remains some hope that you change your mind.

Preordered.
