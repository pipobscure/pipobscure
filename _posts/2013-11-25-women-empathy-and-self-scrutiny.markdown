[Women, Empathy and Self-Scrutiny](http://youtu.be/Eg8YWzklRrg)

> A great video related to this blog’s occasional theme of body-positivity and self care. It’s a funny, charming and inspired video. Be at least as kind and empathetic to yourself as you would be to others. 

Thoughtfulness in a very funny package. A powerful argument for selfishness in women, and one that should be heeded more often.
