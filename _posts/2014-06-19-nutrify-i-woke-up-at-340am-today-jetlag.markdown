> I woke up at 3:40am today… jetlag silliness -> nail therapy. This is my first attempt at french tips. I tried to do tape but it was hard to keep polish from leaking underneath the tape and I found free-handing to be easier (I held brush and turned nail). Beauty of gel polish is you can take off the last layer with some alcohol+paper towel before you gel it and restart. =) It doesn’t start drying on as you paint.
