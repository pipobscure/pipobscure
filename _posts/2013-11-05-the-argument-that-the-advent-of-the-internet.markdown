The argument that the advent of the Internet somehow marks a Telecom Year Zero after which nothing will ever be the same can be made only by ignoring the actual history of literature. Look at Kafka’s obsession with telephones; or the way the phonograph, for Bram Stoker, mirrors the vampire as a machine for bringing the dead to life (or, conversely, storing the living in dead form); or at the obsessive attention Samuel Richardson’s Clarissa is forced to pay to ink and desks and messengers.

Tom McCarthy and other authors on technology and writing [Writing Bytes - NYTimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/books/review/writing-bytes.html?_r=0&adxnnl=1&smid=tw-nytimes&partner=rss&emc=rss&adxnnlx=1383397313-8E3thH0O4xSKY5u16swzfA&pagewanted=all) (via [thisistheverge](http://thisistheverge.tumblr.com/))

Technological change is as old as technology. And every time around “the entire world changes completely like never before”.
