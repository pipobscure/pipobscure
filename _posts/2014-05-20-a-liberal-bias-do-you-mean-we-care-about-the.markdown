A liberal bias? Do you mean we care about the poor, the sick, and the maimed? Do we care about whether people are being shot every day on the streets of America? If that’s liberal, so be it.

I never understood how [liberal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal) could ever be used by conservatives as an epithet of abuse. After all, it simply means **a political or social philosophy advocating the freedom of the individual** or exactly what their ideal America is all about. It’s sort of like the Pope denouncing people as **orthodox catholics**
