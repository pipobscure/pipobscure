It’s about a chicken who kept alerting other farm animals that a fox is trying to eat it. The animals rushed to the rescue just to be laughed at by the chicken who fooled them. And when one day a fox was really trying to get him and he screamed for help, no one came and the chicken got eaten.

Except right now the wolves are regularly devouring sheep and the foxes are feating on chickens. So I hope that before we get sick of it the farmers will take care of the wolf and fox problem.
