> “Foods rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids like almonds and almond flour should be stored in dark place with tightly closed containers in the refrigerator or freezer to prevent oxidation.
> 
> If they are not frozen, they should be used within a week of opening to prevent oxidation.
> 
> In addition, it’s recommended that these fats should never be heated on the stove or baked, especially with high temperatures or for long periods of time.”
