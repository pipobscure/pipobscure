That is a lie!

The average person never runs 7k without walking. So the time it takes an average person to run 7k is infinite. It did not take you infinity plus 10 minutes to run 7k, because you actually have completed the run already.

Therefore you have lied!

Don’t lie again, you are obviously better than that ;)
