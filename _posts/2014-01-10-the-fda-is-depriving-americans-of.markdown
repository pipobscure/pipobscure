The \[FDA is depriving Americans of Mimolette\]([http://m.sfgate.com/food/cheesecourse/article/FDA-bans-Mimolette-over-mites-used-on-rind-4926637.php](http://m.sfgate.com/food/cheesecourse/article/FDA-bans-Mimolette-over-mites-used-on-rind-4926637.php)) which I find absolutely awesome.

Why, you ask, do I approve of FDA stupidity? Simple: as a result, there is now an abundance of Mimolette, which happens to be delicious, available. So much in fact, that for the first time in memory (at least mine) it is actually on offer at a discount. And that in turn makes it delectable without destroying my budget.

So thank you FDA for being so strict/stupid!
