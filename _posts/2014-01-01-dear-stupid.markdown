If you decide to block the only thoroughfare at a train station and a kid falls over your luggage it’s a pretty dumb move to get in the kids face, especially if just behind the kid is it’s father that’s about double your size.

When you the get told to chill by your girl friend as well as the father of said kid, it’s never smart to throw a punch at said father.

If said father then decides not to engage in fisticuffs, but rather simply knees you in the balls and leaves it’s pretty silly to swear at your (ex?)girlfriend when she is leaving you there.

Here us some free advice:

1.  Don’t be an inconsiderate asshat
2.  Don’t have a go at kids
3.  Don’t pick a fight you are going to loose
4.  Don’t swear at your girl

These are just some basics, once you grasp those, there is a whole advanced class in being a man as well.

(P.S.: No I was not the dad in question, though I did empathize with him)
