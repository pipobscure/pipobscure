I have held a US license since 1994 and an Austrian license since 1996. Nevertheless the UK government in its infinite wisdom held it necessary that I actually get a British license, theory practical and all. But only after a year, because that long my license is considered valid in the UK.

Ok, I thought, I can do that and went on to do them. No problem. What did get me though is that my car insurance company was aware of all of this. So when I informed them, as I was obliged to, that I had indeed confirmed fully with the law, they decided this would be a good opportunity to increase my car insurance by a factor of 3.5. After all, I had just gotten my license and could not drive worth shit having only 1 day of experience.

Several freak-outs and polite invectives later that is now my former insurer. I then found myself a new company. It’s a bit more expensive than my previous one (+50% or a factor of 1.5) but still cheaper than the £&@€$Which leaves me with just one question: Who defecated into their cerebrae? What kind of numb-scull would think that’s a solid way to do business?
