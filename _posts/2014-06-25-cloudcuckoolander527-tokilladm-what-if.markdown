That way we’d be rewarding the success and even if you flunked the semester, you still wouldn’t have to pay for ALL of the tuition

That’s sort of like my _get the vote out_ scheme: Set the income tax at 95% and give people that show up to vote a tax voucher that takes taxes down to where they are now. Same thing would happen to tuitions rather than costing and arm and a leg, they cost two arms and two legs. Well yeah, you only pay what you failed, but it’s going to still be an arm and a leg.
