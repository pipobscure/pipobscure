Instead of saying “I don’t have time” try saying “it’s not a priority,” and see how that feels. Often, that’s a perfectly adequate explanation. I have time to iron my sheets, I just don’t want to. But other things are harder. Try it: “I’m not going to edit your résumé, sweetie, because it’s not a priority.” “I don’t go to the doctor because my health is not a priority.” If these phrases don’t sit well, that’s the point. Changing our language reminds us that time is a choice. If we don’t like how we’re spending an hour, we can choose differently.

I catch myself sometimes sayin “I don’t have time” not because it sounds bad to me as “it’s not a priority”, but it sounds bad to others that want me to do things. To it sounds just right to say “it so low in priority that it didn’t even make it into the to 10000 list of things I need to do”
