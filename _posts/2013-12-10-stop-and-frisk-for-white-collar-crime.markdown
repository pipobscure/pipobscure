> In [a clip from The Daily Show](http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-august-13-2013/frisky-business---jessica-williams) in August, Jessica Williams completely skewers [the Bloomberg administrationâ€™s asinine stop-and-frisk policing](http://www.nyclu.org/issues/racial-justice/stop-and-frisk-practices) by advocating for a stop-and-frisk policy for white collar criminals on Wall Street (aka Business Harlem).

This video is so perfect.
