> As an older man who runs a tumblr, I often find myself looking at my friends and colleagues and thinking how clueless they are about what younger people think, what they really want out of life, and what they value in this world. I know tumblr’s vision is probably skewed, but I do think I’ve learned a lot here, and that it’s made me a better person.

As an older man on tumblr, I often find myself looking in the mirror thinking how clueless I am about what younger people think, what they really want out of life, what they value in this world. I know tumblr’s vision is probably skewed, but I do think I am learning a lot here and it is inspiring to keep trying to make this a better place for all.
