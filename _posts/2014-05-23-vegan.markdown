# Vegan

I have decided to go vegan, except I don’t really have the time.

So I was just going to be vegan like half the time, like from 9pm to 7am. But then I figured that would be a bit too half assed so I added in from 7:30am to 12noon an from 1pm to 6pm.

So since that’s like most of the day, it’s like totally cool now.
