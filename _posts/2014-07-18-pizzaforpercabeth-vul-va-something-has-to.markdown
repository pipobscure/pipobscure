Friendly reminder that so long as Palestinians deny Israel’s right to exist and support Hamas in calling for its destruction there can be nothing but admiration for Israeli restraint. Under 500 dead? That’s called restraint when rockets are being hurled at you. If Israel really wanted to hurt Palestinian civilians the death toll the death toll would be in the 10000s by now.
