Forcing people to register a separate account with disqus with an email and a password, is not streamlining. It’s stupidly adding a hurdle to commenting. If I want to comment, I want to do so with one of my online identities like twitter. I don’t then want sign up with your messed up system.

Boycot disqus for stupidity!

P.S.: Not that LifeFyre et. al. is any better.
