  actually also a beautiful park to wander in), I think I’ll desist.

I love history and eclectic research, so I tried a search of the relevant names in the cemetary records (they are on the internet). Sadly nothing can be learned there.

However we do know that on the 9th of November 1938 the Nazis destroyed one mourning hall and defaced another in the jewish section of the central cemetary. They also ransacked many of the graves, Babette Beer’s final resting place likely among them. If that were not enough, the final battles for Vienna in 1945 were fought between the Russion and German armies on the grounds of the cemetary. So while i was tempted to actually go and find her grave (it’s actually also a beautiful park to wander in), I think I’ll desist.
