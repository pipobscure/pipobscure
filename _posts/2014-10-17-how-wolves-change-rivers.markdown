[How Wolves Change Rivers](http://youtu.be/ysa5OBhXz-Q)

The power of the wolf. Or what small changes in an ecosystem can do. This is a positive example of why we should be worried when species threaten to go extinct.

As long as a species is around, we can reintroduce them when we made the mistake of removing them. Once they are extinct though, we are screwed.
