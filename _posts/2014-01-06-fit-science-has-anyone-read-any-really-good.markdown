> Has anyone read any really good keto books?? Specifically quite scientific ones?? Please Recommend :)

I recommend this [The Art and Science of Low-Carbohydrate Living](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Science-Low-Carbohydrate-Living-ebook/dp/B005CVV2AE/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1389048888&sr=1-1&keywords=low+carbohydrate+living). Itâ€™s absolutely excellent and written by people who actually do the research.
