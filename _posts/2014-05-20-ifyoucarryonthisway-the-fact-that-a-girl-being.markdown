> the fact that a girl being a feminist is a turn off to a lot of guys is just further proof that sexism exists they’re literally saying they don’t want a girl who requires respect because that’s just no fun 

So what’s your point? The fact that it’s raining means there is water in the sky. Big surprise. So what?

Let me tell you something. Most people get exactly the amount of respect from others that they give themselves.

**Thing is: that can be both good and bad.**

If a woman doesn’t have any respect for herself, she’s more likely to be in an abusive relationship; a woman in an abusive relationship is also less likely to have/gain any respect for herself.

_On the other hand._

A woman that is self-confident and respects herself (and other women, which happens to be the definition of feminism), is more likely to be in a supportive and respectful relationship. And a woman in a supportive relationship is much more likely to respect herself.

So rather than spout quaint deprecatory snark, maybe it’s time to realise that you get what you ask for. If you ask all shy and scared: “Honey would it turn you off if labeled myself a feminist?” and then be surprised if he says yes it may just be time to realise that for every man out there that finds feminism a turn off, there are two dozen that find a strong self-respecting female partner the biggest turn on there is. So rather than being self deprecatory and at the same time complain about douche-bags, maybe realise that likely as not you are right just the way you are and assert that. Then maybe you don’t have to yammer as much.
