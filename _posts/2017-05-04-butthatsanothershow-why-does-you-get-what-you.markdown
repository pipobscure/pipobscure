Guess what: It actually does work the same way!

Just as you are happy to buy that cheap disposable lighter for less that £1 that you throw away when the gas gets low, many employers are happy to throw away that cheap disposable worker when he/she/it stops working as expected.

Just like that disposable lighter performs its task well enough for you, that disposable worker performs her/his/its task good enough for the business.

The real question should be if there isn’t some inherent difference between objects and people that should cause a difference in treatment. But by drawing similes like:

**Why does “you get what you pay for” only apply to consumers and not employers?**

that difference gets obliterated.
