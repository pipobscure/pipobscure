[Jennifer Government by Max Barry](http://www.amazon.com/Jennifer-Government-Max-Barry/dp/1400030927/ref=sr\_1\_1)

> Taxation has been abolished, the government has been privatized, and employees take the surname of the company they work for. It’s a brave new corporate world…

… and it’s an awesome book I just reread. It is the alternative history to 1984. What if it’s not government that goes crazy, but corporations?

It’s what would have happened if Ayn Rand had gotten her way. And it makes for an enticing story.
