When did the future switch from being a promise to being a threat?

_Invisible Monsters_, Chuck Palahniuk (via [the-pineapple-effect](http://the-pineapple-effect.tumblr.com/))

It never has, it’s just a perception. If you feel depressed the future looms threatening.

However if you are positive, the the future is full of chances and exciting possibilities; of exiting things to see and do; of ways to improve your own and others lives.

I’d rather look at the future as an experiment in untried things.
