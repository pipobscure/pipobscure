Dear Lady at Sainsburry’s,

when an assortment of buttons is mispackaged on a backing that says “Sewing Machine Bobbins” that does not make them bobbins. Please do not try to tell me that “well they are called bobbins”.

If you don’t know what a bobbin is, then look at the last picture. That is a bobbin. I wouldn’t mind you not knowing what a bobbin actually is, but I do mind when you are clueless yet insist on lecturing me on the very topic.

Kind regards, pip
