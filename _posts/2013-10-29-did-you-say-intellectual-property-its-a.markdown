[Did You Say “Intellectual Property”? It's a Seductive Mirage](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html)

Richard Stallman on the term “Intellectual Property”. A very calm and reasoned exposition on why the term is an over-generalisation.

You can like or dislike Stallman and his philosophy, but this piece is a simple exposition without any actual philosophical argument.
