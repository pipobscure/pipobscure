> More specifically, I trust in the scientific method.  Science isn’t the surface scratchings or headlines you see published in newspapers. Many scientific studies are published without appropriate disclaimers in the media, and are presented as facts when in truth the study may have said that further study is needed. Thus I’m always skeptical of science news headlines.
