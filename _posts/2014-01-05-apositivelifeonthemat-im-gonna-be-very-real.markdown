> I’m gonna be very real right now.

> I’m usually very grateful for tumblr. I’m more educated on social issues, like feminism, racism or gender issues. I have met amazing people that I like to call my friends. I found new shows to watch, new books to read. New foods to try and I learned a lot about…

Read this and think about it.

Then if you see someone being an arse, unfollow and be done with them. The cool thing about tumblr is that you choose whose comments you see. I for one simply unfollow negativity and try to support anyone struggling with a kind word.

So here is yours: You choose what you read choose wisely and only read what brings you forward. All in all there are more good people than bad out there, more support than contamination.
