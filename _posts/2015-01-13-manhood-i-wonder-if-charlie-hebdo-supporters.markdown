> I wonder if Charlie Hebdo supporters would think it was funny if people made satire of the murders in Paris. Would they still be talking about freedom of speech? After all, Charlie Hebdo had no problem making fun of tragedies such as Boko Haram raping the underage girls they held hostage. Would they still be whipping out Voltaire quotes if the tables were turned?

You see that’s the point: they did what you consider tasteless satire that I would personally disapprove of; yet I didn’t go on a killing spree.

You see that’s the point: it truly is about freedom of expression

You see that’s the point: nothing deserves inherent respect; respect is earned; I don’t have to and shouldn’t have to give a fuck about your feelings so long as I tolerate you having the exact same right to express yourself and feel that i do.
