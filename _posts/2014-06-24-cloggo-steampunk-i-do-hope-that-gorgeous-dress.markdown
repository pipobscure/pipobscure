  legs as well as part of the steering system. By using the legs to shape the
  cloth that in turns shapes the air-stream from the rockets. And that’s how you
  steer. That dress is not just pretty, it’ the perfect rocketeering outfit as
  well."

Well of course it’s fire-proof: it’s an integral part of protecting the legs as well as part of the steering system. By using the legs to shape the cloth that in turns shapes the air-stream from the rockets. And that’s how you steer. That dress is not just pretty, it’ the perfect rocketeering outfit as well.
