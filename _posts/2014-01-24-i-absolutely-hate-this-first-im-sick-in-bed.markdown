I absolutely hate this. First I’m sick in bed, then my iPhone refuses to charge because of a broken port.

I just got this cheap ass abdroid phone as a stop-gap. Well looking on the bright side, it’s small and cute (quoting my 8yr old daughter). I think I’ll let her decorate with hello kitty stickers.

I am so glad right now that I have like the slimest fingers ever seen on a man, or I would never be able to type on this thing.
