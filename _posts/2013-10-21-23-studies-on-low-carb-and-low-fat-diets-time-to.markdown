[23 Studies on Low-Carb and Low-Fat Diets - Time to Retire The Fad](http://authoritynutrition.com/23-studies-on-low-carb-and-low-fat-diets/)

> Over 20 studies have compared low-carb and low-fat diets. Low-carb diets consistently lead to better results, both for weight loss and common risk factors.

I didnâ€™t do a studdy, but empirically I have been living ultra low carb with regular medical checks for 12+ months now.

I lost around 40 kg and am the fittest I have been since puberty. My blood levels are right where the text-books want them. I am doing things that would have given me a cardiac episode a couple of years ago.

I basically live of fat and proteins with almost 0 carbs. So just from personal experience I call BS on low-carb diets being bad for you.
