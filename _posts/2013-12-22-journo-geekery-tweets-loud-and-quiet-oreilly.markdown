In comparative terms, almost nobody on Twitter is somebody: the median Twitter account has a single follower. Among the much smaller subset of accounts that have posted in the last 30 days, the median account has just 61 followers.

Which is why I find tumblr so much more interesting. It seems like a much more spread out kind of place where there are a lot of things from a lot of people for a lot of tastes, but few to none mega-stars.

If I am still following you after a week or two, then I actually find what you post interesting, fun or otherwise enjoyable. So keep going!
