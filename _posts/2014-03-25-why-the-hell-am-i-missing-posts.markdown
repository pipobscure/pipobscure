# Why the hell am I missing posts?

I just checked manually through some of my favorite blogs. These are blogs that I assumed would show up in my dashboard, because I explicitly follow them. However for some odd reason there are oodles of posts that simply did not show up in my dashboard.

Whatâ€™s with that. I mean what do I have to do to actually get all the posts I subscribed to?

**HELP!!!**
