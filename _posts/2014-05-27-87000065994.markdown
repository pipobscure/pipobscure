> Iâ€™ve had something in my right eye since last night. I tried over and over to get it out to no avail. I cried, and it has not been flushed out. I have yet to flip my eyelid out (though, not for a lack of trying), and Iâ€™m sure whatever it is is stuck under there. I can feel it scratching when I blink.

Dann you! Now you made my eye itch in a psychosomatic bout of sympathy.
