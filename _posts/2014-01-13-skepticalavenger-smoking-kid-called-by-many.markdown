  real commitment and stubbornness and a willingness to risk being a real ass to

It’s just so much easier to never start rather than quit. Quitting takes real commitment and stubbornness and a willingness to risk being a real ass to everyone around you all at the same time. It’s just a lot easier to quit tomorrow.
