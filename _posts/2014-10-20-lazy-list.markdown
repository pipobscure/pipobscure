> 1.  I want a cup of coffee but it nearly 630pm so yeah, no
> 2.  I had a glorious lazy unproductive day with one of those great naps where sleeping really isn’t the object, and you doze off comfortably and actually wake up refreshed not groggy and cranky
> 3.  My hip & knee are still sore but gym tomorrow… leg day… oh crap!

You are denying yourself coffee just because it’s 6:30? Insanity!

What’s next? Stop taking in oxygen because it’s midnight?
