title: "One time in like 5th grade I had this teacher and she gave us all
  bottles of shit like this and told us to squeeze it all out and of course we
  were like fuck yeah and did it and then she said, “Now, try and shove it all
  back in the container.” Of course we all tried, and then stared at her
  confused as shit. When we all obviously gave up, she said, “In the moment, you
  were so consumed with what you were doing that you didn’t realize the mess you
  were making. Then, after it was so quickly and easily poured out, you realize
  it is impossible to put it all back in. Remember this for the rest of your
  lives when it comes to the words that come out of your mouth” and we were like
  10 so we were like yeah ok whatever lady, but somehow to this day I think of
  it constantly."
