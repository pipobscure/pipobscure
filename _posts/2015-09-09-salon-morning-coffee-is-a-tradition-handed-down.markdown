> > Morning coffee is a tradition handed down from generation to generation, embedded into our psyches maybe from the moment some cave person discovered that a beverage could be made from burnt beans. Surely that discovery happened in the morning! Funny thing, though. Modern science has a way of looking at traditions and often turning them upside down. It turns out that we have had it all wrong. Early morning is actually the worst time to drink coffee.

Note: Scientists didn’t say “morning is a bad time for coffee” they said “it’s the worst time for coffee”.

That’s because they know there is no such thing as a “bad time for coffee”. It would be an oxymoron.
