[How Pabst Blue Ribbon became a billion-dollar beer](http://qz.com/184372/how-pabst-blue-ribbon-became-a-billion-dollar-beer/)

> Pabst Brewing Co., the 170-year-old brewery that makes Pabst Blue Ribbonâknown as “PBR” to the mustachioed cognoscentiâis for sale, Reuters reported over the weekend. And the expectation is that the company will fetch as much as $1 billion. The past decade has been an incredible one for the brewery, and especially for its namesake beer….

Which reminds me of my favorite joke:

What’s the difference between **American Beer** and **Sex in a row-boat**?

**None**, it’s both fucking close to water
