[Lexicon by Maxx Barry](http://www.amazon.com/Lexicon-Maxx-Barry/dp/1594205388/ref=sr\_1\_1?ie=UTF8)

I just finished another book by Maxx Barry. This is definitely a worthwhile author. After “Jennifer Government” this book goes of in an entirely different direction: What if words and language were capable of controlling human behaviour and some humans learned this skill. Another great read!
