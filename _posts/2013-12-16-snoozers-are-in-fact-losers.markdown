Fascinating. I may have to rethink my alarm clock. Maybe I’d be better of getting those “daylight bulbs” they use for green houses and putting a dimmer switch on a timer instead. This way I can have slowly increasing light in the two hours before I actually need to be awake. Basically simulating sunrise.

Actually waiting for sunrise just doesn’t work, at least not during winter.
