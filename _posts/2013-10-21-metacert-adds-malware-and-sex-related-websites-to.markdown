I find this an incredibly silly approach. It shows that these guys are still living in the past century. It’s not like we haven’t realised yet that filtering does not work. Whether you filter porn to prevent malware or twitter to prevent political resistance, filtering is recognised by the internet as a malfunction and will be routed around. It’s high time that we stop advertising the restriction of access to a solution to a problem, the restriction of access to unencumbered pipes is itself the problem.
