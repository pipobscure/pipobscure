Actually it’s because America values free speech.

In Germany there are still neo-nazis and the old nazis aren’t entirely gone either. As a matter of fact they are the ones enforcing limits on expression today.

America is simply confident enough to be able to deal with their problematic idiots in an open exchange.

Now whether that confidence is justified, remains to be seen. Ferguson (and the like) suggest otherwise.

One thing’s sure though: prohibiting idiocy has never stopped it before.
