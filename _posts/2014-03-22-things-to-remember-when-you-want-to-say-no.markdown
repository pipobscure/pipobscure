> 1.  If I say “no” to someone and they get angry, this does not mean I should have said “yes.”
> 2.  Saying “no” does not make me selfish.
> 3.  Although I want to please the people I care about, I do not have to please them all the time.
> 4.  It is okay to want or need something from someone else. 
> 5.  My wants and needs are just as important as those of anyone else.
> 6.  I have the right to assert myself, even if I may inconvenience others.
