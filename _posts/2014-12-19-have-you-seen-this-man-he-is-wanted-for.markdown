Have you seen this man?

He is wanted for international espionage\[1\] in aid of a foreign invasion\[2\] by an autocrat\[3\] from North of Korea\[4\].

If you see him inform local law-enforcement. To become part of a permanent neighbourhood watch against the nefarious acts of such villains sign up at [https://richarddawkins.net](https://richarddawkins.net)

  
\[1\] that’s his whole purpose. If he worked for the U.S. he’d be employed by the NSA  
\[2\] what else would you call a nocturnal intrusion on your territory?  
\[3\] on the North Pole what Santa says is the law. That’s the definition of autocrat  
\[4\] Yes the North Pole is “North OF Korea” :)
