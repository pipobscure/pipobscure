Saw this “Hungarian Specialty” today and got my wife one.

**Pure poison**

The ingredients are basically:

*   water, salt & yeast
*   white flour (i.e.: pure carbs)
*   massive amounts sugar (i.e.: even purer carbs)
*   butter & cinnamon

basically I think I have overindulged and gone off keto just by looking at the damn thing.

_These types of bakery items are the only time I actually miss eating carbs somewhat. It passes quite quickly though_

P.S.: Tonight we are going out for Hungarian food, which is basically fried fat in lard, served with grease. It’s going to be delicious.
