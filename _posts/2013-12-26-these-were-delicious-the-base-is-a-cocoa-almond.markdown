These were delicious!

The base is a cocoa-almond tart:

*   Almond-Flour
*   1 Egg
*   Coconut Oil
*   Vanilla
*   Unsweetened Cocoa Powder

The white “filling” is a coconut lemon cream:

*   Coconut Flakes
*   Mascarpone
*   Lemon Juice
*   Gelatine
*   Stevia

And on top I poured a bit of melted 86% chocolate.

It made christmas dinner so much nicer having a delicious desert while the family had chocolate fondue.
