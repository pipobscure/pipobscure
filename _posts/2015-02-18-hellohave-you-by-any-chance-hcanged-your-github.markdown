*Question: *Hello,Have you by any chance hcanged your Github nickname from pipobscure to strongloop? Thanks, Benjamin

*Answer: *Nope, but I did transfer my fsevents project to strong loop. They will be maintaining it far better than I ever could. They have already done a lot of good things such as getting TravisCI to work and fixing some issues, so this means that fsevents has a better chance of becoming a much more solid thing. I myself am still pipobscure both here, on Twitter as well as on GitHub. Cheers, Philipp
