I so understand where you are coming from. I did the same thing around thanksgiving. Except the weeks afterwards my digestion was off and I totally felt like crap. So I swore to myself to give myself treats that actually make me feel good, not “treats” that I regret for weeks.

I hope for you you are more “exception tolerant” than I am and that you will actually not regret that burger and pizza.

As long as one feels good about onesself, everything is legit.
