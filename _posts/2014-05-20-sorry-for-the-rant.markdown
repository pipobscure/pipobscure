… sometimes I just get frustrated at the sheer abundance of self loathing on tumblr and the whining it leads to, especially when it’s self evident.

Yeah, sexism exists. You don’t need to reiterate that. No one with even half a brain-cell will deny it. Just look around; there is a plethora of evidence.
