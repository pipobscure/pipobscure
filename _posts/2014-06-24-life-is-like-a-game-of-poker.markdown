# Life is like a game of poker

I am not really into gambling. The most I have ever gambled was playing poker for gummy-bears. But this year like does feel like a game of poker, or at least how I imagine it feeling.

For years I have been talking of leaving the country and moving somewhere else. This spring life dealt me a hand that allowed me to go for it. It looked hard into my eyes and said:

**“I think you have been bluffing”**

Well now we had to make a choice and we showed our hand. Well we are winning that game. I found a job in London. The last two weeks we were there to find a place to live, a school for the kids, and do a lot the administrative tasks.

London treated us like a charm. A city is so different when you are there with a view toward staying. And then our time was up. It was back to Austria for a week before going on our holiday to the US that we had planned/booked for like a year.

Being in London felt like winning that game of poker. I could almost feel the chips on my arms as I proverbially shovelled them toward me with every step in setting up life there. Leaving London felt awful, because I had to give all those chips back to the croupier, watching lovingly as they go back to the office.

No I’m just sitting here, waiting for them to come out with the actual winnings. **I so can’t wait to go back and actually live there!**
