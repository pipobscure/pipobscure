This is actually pretty silly, because **conservative** by definition means **want no change**. So anything that has ever happened on the planet was opposed by _conservatives_ and achieved despite them.

**Conservatives opposed Christianity over Judaism** - _Christians won_

Sounds stupid, but is just as true.
