You see, there are at least two sides to the story. And being that there are currently missiles being shot at Israel, tunnels with weapons being found, and missiles demonstrably being hidden in schools, there is very little sympathy for Palestinians.

So until Palestinians realise that Hamas, in their goal of violent destruction of Israel, does not serve them they are the biggest obstacle to their own safety.
