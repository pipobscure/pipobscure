# tolerance vs. acceptance

Maybe it is time to reacquaint ourselves with the definitions of some words.

[tolerance](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/tolerance) (noun)

> The ability or willingness to tolerate the existence of opinions or behaviour that one dislikes or disagrees with.

[tolerate](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/tolerate) (verb)

> Allow the existence, occurrence, or practice of something that one dislikes or disagrees with, without interference.

[acceptance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance) (noun)

> The action of consenting to receive or undertake something offered.

or

> Agreement with or belief in an idea or explanation.

Just as a reminder: **Our society requires of anyone wanting to live within it the acceptance of our norms (laws).** Among these norms is religious tolerance, an important achievement in the development of western civilisation. Never mistake that with _religious acceptance_ however! We only offer _religious tolerance_ and **not** _religious acceptance_. **Do not presume to foist any dictum of your superstition upon our society. Not as an excuse; not as a guiding principle; not as the basis for our norms.**
