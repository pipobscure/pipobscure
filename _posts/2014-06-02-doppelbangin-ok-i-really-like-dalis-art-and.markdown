> ok i REALLY like dali’s art and his museum is The Coolest Ever i would absolutely go back there. but my favorite work of his was a very simple drawing of two or three fancy ladies stand outdoors in the nude except for large hats and dainty shoes, i think. and this was a very simple and not at all…

Is that it?
