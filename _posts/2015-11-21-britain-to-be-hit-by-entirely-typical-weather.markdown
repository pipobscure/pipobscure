# Britain to be hit by entirely typical weather

Temperatures in the UK are going to fall sharply over the coming weeks because that is what happens at this time of year.

Meteorologists believe that winter, a spell of short, cold days commonly defined as a season, will be more or less exactly what you would expect.

Professor Henry Brubaker of the Institute for Studies said: “Household fuel costs will rise considerably as families try to increase the temperature of their homes.“

“People on the verge of death may die.“

“Ice and snow will create icy, snowy conditions.“

“Your car will refuse to start.“

“Because it’s winter.“

“It’s really nothing to freak out about, unless you’re a pre-Neanderthal cave dweller who believes sunsets are caused by Gark, the angry moon god.”

He added: “There’s a high probability that this winter will be followed by another sudden, weather-related phenomenon known as spring.”

Housewife Nikki Hollis said: “The important thing is to stay inside, carry a flaming torch at all times and don’t be sentimental about eating your plumpest child.”
