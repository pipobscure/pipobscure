**what saying “not all men” should mean:**

Not all men agree that:

*   rape
*   coercion
*   condescension
*   inequality

are perfectly alright. So if you think that all men think like you misogynist, chauvinist asshat, then **you are wrong**

Until that is made so perfectly crystal clear, I will repurpose _not all men_, because that is the only valid use for that statement.
