Now, this is a story all about how My life got flip turned upside down And I’d like to take a minute Just sit right there I’ll tell you how I became The President and abolished welfare

In Queens New York I was born and raised A rich man’s playground is where I spent most of my days Chillin’ out maxin’ relaxin’ all cool And all shootin some black kids outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to no good Started making money in my neighborhood I bought out all of their businesses til they got scared Dad said ‘You’re going it alone with a billion I have spare’

I whistled for my limo and when it came near The license plate said “Pres” and it had a c\*\*t in the mirror If anything I wondered what the driver was on But I thought nah, forget it, yo homes, Washington!

I pulled up to the white house about seven or eight And I yelled to the driver “Yo, homes fire you later!” I looked at my kingdom I was finally there To sit on my throne as The Pres with sh\*\* hair
