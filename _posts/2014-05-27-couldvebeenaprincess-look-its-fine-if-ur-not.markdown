> look it’s fine if ur not religious omg it’s 100% ok but once u start telling people that their prayers are worthless, that God isn’t listening, that He is imaginary, that Jesus didn’t exist, that their religious texts are garbage, etc. then you’re a piece of shit shut up

It’s fine if you are religious. In fact it’s 100% Ok. But the moment you tell someone that they’ll go to hell or that your faith is the only true one or that laws should be made in accordance to what your imaginary friend supposedly wants, you become an inexcusable asshole.
