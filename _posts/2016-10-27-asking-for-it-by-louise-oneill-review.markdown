[Asking For It by Louise O'Neill- review](https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/apr/10/asking-for-it-louise-oneill-review?0p19G=c)

When I read this book I had to put it down half way through. Itâ€™s too depressing a story to read in one go without an interruption to regain some cheer. I finished it after a day of pause and it still haunts me days after finishing it. And what makes it so depressing is that it is in fact a realistic mirror held to the world we live in.
