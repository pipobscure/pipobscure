I just found out that my driving license will no longer be valid in Britain after August 9th because back in 1994 I took my driving test in the U.S.

So I’ll have to go and take the theoretical and practical exam and get a British license.

In all likelihood the person administering my exams will have been alive for fewer years than I have been driving. Now that’s what I call silly!
