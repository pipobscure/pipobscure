> The most dangerous phrase in the language is, “we’ve always done it this way.”

Not just is this an incredibly true quote by one of the greatest women of the last century, but it is also **the single most important thing to understand**.

To keep everything as it has always been is dangerous. To attempt to keep everything the same if harmful and will destroy everything we value. By attempting to conserve what is we will destroy it.

Only when we realise the truth in Admiral Hoppers words and make them our daily reminder to seek out change, to seek to shape the future will he have a chance to preserve what we love and we and our fore-bearers have achieved.
