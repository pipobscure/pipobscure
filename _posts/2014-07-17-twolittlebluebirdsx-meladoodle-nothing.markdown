Come on! You must be over the age where you need a pacifier-pocket.

My theory is that since women have realised that they don’t really need men, and can just keep one around as a plaything while they are infatuated, we men have conspired to create an artificial dependence. This way your man is the keeper/carrying-mule for phones, money, keys and assorted junk. What else are we good for?
