# Atheist are too smart to get caught killing

According to a [speech by Phil Zimmerman](http://ffrf.org/publications/freethought-today/item/13467-the-goodness-of-godlessness)

> \[Atheists\] are better educated and maybe even a little bit smarter.

and

> only 0.2% of U.S. prisoners are atheists

Doesn’t mean atheists are more ethical, just that we don’t get caught ;)

Thanks to [The Logic Police](http://thelaurenblairbitchproject.tumblr.com/post/72578904723) for pointing me at the speech. A fun read!
