title: Just did the quiz as well. The embarrassing thing with this is that
  roughly 50% of participants got a failing grade (less than 65% correct). Now
  these are all things that you either learn in high-school or that make regular
  appearances on the news. So there weren’t really any questions on there that
  require any serious training, skill or expertise more than not sleepwalking
  through life. Yet a majority of people couldn’t get a passing grade.
