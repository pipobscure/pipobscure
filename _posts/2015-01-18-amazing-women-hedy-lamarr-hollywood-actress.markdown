Why so presumptive? She is worshipped by Wifians everywhere.

First Ada Lovelace gave us some programming fundamentals, then Grace Hopper gave us the idea of hardware independent programming, and then Hedy Lamarr gave us frequency hopping as fundamental in WiFi leading to desk-independence.

Then they said: “Ok the big challenges are done, we can let the little boys onto the playground now”

Any geek worth their salt does worship these three!
