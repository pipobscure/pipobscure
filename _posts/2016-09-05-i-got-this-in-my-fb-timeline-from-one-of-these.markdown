I got this in my FB-Timeline from one of these joke sites. Usually there’s a bunch of dad-jokes that give one a quick giggle but that aren’t really all that funny.

Any case, this one made gave me quite a bit to think about.

*   Differing perspectives
*   Propagand in news-media
*   How prevalent antisemitism is not just in “Arab Newspapers”

It’s definitely worth giving a bit of thought to what it is we consume in our news-media, and it’s definitely worth it to go out of ones way to try give some differing opinions a read as well.
