*Question: *You know what I love about Irish people? You're upmost reluctance to admit that leprechauns are real.

*Answer: *For national security reasons I can neither explicitly confirm nor deny the existence of leprechauns. However if I was to comment on the entity that is leprechauns and question their reality, which I am not. I would say that there’s a possibility that they maybe could be real. But that’s not what I’m saying because as I said before I cannot remark on their actuality.

I might consider politics as a future career path.
