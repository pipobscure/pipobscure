I just have one question about this recipe:

It’s capitalised so that it could be some kind of product I have not heard of (like brown sugar flavoured stevia maybe?) Because if it’s not, then I need someone to explain to me how you can call a cake where a quarter of the dry mass is sugar can be called “low carb”.

P.S.: I would have asked directly, but I found no way to message or ask anything of cookinlowcarb. This is actually a question so -> ?
