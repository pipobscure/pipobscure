Hey, it’s a legitimate question.

I would assume he’d be in the White House, but I don’t know because contrary to popular belief, Christmas still is on the school calendar. And we are highly unlikely to ever find out because when Christmas is indeed removed from the school calendar as it should be, it will be because we have realised the value behind the separation of church and state and not “because of Muslims”.
