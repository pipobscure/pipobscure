Dear Mr. Brian Brenberg,  
I have seldomly read such utter nonsense. The King’s College of NYC should be ashamed to count you among their professors.

While it is true that “the money has to come from somewhere”, employment is not simply a question of supply and demand. So when the labour costs more than your product is worth, you are selling your product too cheaply. If you cannot turn a profit on your product without exploiting your labour force, you should not be making your product.
