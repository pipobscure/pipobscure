The packer who was packing up her groceries told her I was Deaf and her response to him was ‘She should learn to listen better if she is going to work in the service industry.’ My packer then tried to continue to explain to which the lady told him that it was still my responsibility to have a conversation with her if she wanted one and that instead of watching the screen to see if her groceries scanned through I should listen to the beeps that way I can talk to her.

Have them tell her that she is in fact not entitled to a conversation from you or anyone else. If she wants someone to listen to her babbling there is a professional she can go to. They are called talk therapists. And they can also help her with that personality issue at the same time.
