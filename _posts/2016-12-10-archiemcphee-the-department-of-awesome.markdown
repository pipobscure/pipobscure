> The [Department of Awesome Automata](http://geyserofawesome.com/tagged/automaton) seldom gets an opportunity to show off, but today they’re pulling out all the stops with this breathtaking [Silver Swan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Swan_(automaton)) automaton. Housed at the [Bowes Museum](http://www.thebowesmuseum.org.uk/) in North East England, this exquisite 18th century clockwork bird was designed by designed and built by [John Joseph Merlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Joseph_Merlin "John Joseph Merlin") along with London inventor [James Cox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cox_(inventor) "James Cox (inventor)").
> 
> The life-size swan automaton swims in a stream made of moving glass rods along with small silver fish. When it’s clockwork is wound up, a music box plays as the swan turns its head from side to side, preening her silver feathers, eventually spotting a fish in the water and then bending down to catch it.
> 
> In effort to preserve this extraordinary creation, the Silver Swan is only operated once each day. But we can watch it as many times as we like [thanks to this video](https://youtu.be/MT05uNFb6hY):
