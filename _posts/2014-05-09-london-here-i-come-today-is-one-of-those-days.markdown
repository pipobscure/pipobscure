London here I come.

Today is one of those days, where everything is just going my way. I spent the last two days in London interviewing for a job. Today I got the call that they want to hire me.

It’s an incredible opportunity and I am really excited. So I guess I now have to figure out how exactly I am going to move my family to London and where precisely to.

If anyone here has any tips for me, I’d be very appreciative.
