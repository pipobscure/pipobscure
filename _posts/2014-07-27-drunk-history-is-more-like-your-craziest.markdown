‘Drunk History’ is more like your craziest autodidact buddy telling you the weirdest story he ever heard about Hitler. The facts are not in dispute, they’re just delivered in a way that is blunt and personal, with biases up front instead of hidden.

**Emily Nussbaum** on the show’s second season: [http://nyr.kr/1nbYRlL](http://nyr.kr/1nbYRlL) (via [newyorker](http://newyorker.tumblr.com/))

I have just seen the first episode. This is incredibly brilliant.
