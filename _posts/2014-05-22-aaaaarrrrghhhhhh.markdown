# Aaaaarrrrghhhhhh

You know when someone is doing a million things and getting into total overload, just because of fear and uncertainty about the future? And then they actually miss all the truly relevant things to actually get to have that future? And then they drive you total nuts with getting you to do totally irrelevant stuff just because they are scared? And you like have no idea how to escape that and not let it drown you much less help that person to escape that vicious cycle?

Well that’s how things are right now. No worries, deep breath, it’ll be fine. I am so chill under fire!
