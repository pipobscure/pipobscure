[I hope the concept of cultural appropriation is a passing fad](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/13/lionel-shrivers-full-speech-i-hope-the-concept-of-cultural-appropriation-is-a-passing-fad)

Someone much more eloquent than I makes the argument against cultural appropriation for fiction writers.

I’d like to extend that argument to all walks of life. More than that “cultural appropriation” is the method cultures and people have grown closer since the dawn of humanity; a first step toward true empathy.
