My secret santa at work obviously likes the fact that I actually cook lunch at the office because I got this fab “low-carb to go” cook book. It’s full of low carb recipes for one person, which is awesome for the office.

As a result I tried one of the recipes today:

Ingredients:

*   1 cup of leaf spinach
*   2 eggs
*   ½ cup cheese
*   megnut
*   ½ cup cottage cheese
*   smoked salmon

You mix the spinach, eggs, cheese and megnut and spread them on a sheet of baking paper. Put that in the oven and bake. Take out the “omlet” and put cottage cheese and salmon on it. Roll it up and let it cool for 20 minutes. Cut it into slices and gobble it up.

Absolutely delicious.
