“\[Christianity\] is either not true, or it is so compellingly utterly true, that almost nothing else matters … If it is \[true\], it’s the most important thing in the universe bar nothing; and if it isn’t, we should close all the churches and sell them off for something else. There is no middle way.” - Tim Farron
