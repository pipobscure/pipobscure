# The Second Amendment

If the framers of the constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights had known to what insidious use the second amendment would be put, I am absolutely certain that the text of the second amendment would be:

    A well balanced education, being necessary to the security and prosperity of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Books, shall not be infringed.
