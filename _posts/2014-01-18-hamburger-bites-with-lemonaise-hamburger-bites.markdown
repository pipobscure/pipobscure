title: Why not olive oil? Well you can. I use it with garlic to make aioli. But
  olive oil has it’s own stronger taste that will cover the lemon too much (just
  my opinion).

Hamburger Bites with Lemonaise

Hamburger bites are basically bite suze pieces of Hamburger.

egg white  
salt / pepper  
spices (I like paprika, garlic & allspice but it’s up to you)

mash up and form little pellets that you then fry.

Lemonaise is “lemon mayonnaise”. While you can buy it in some countries (UK) pre made it just tastes better fresh.

egg yolk (use the leftovers from the hamburger bites)  
lemon juice (1 lemon should be enough)  
salt  
vegetable oil (not olive oil)

mix the lemon, salt & yolk in a blender. While keeping the blender on, slowly drip oil in until you have the right consistency.
