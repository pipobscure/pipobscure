This is a traditional coffee in Austria called “Einspänner”. Basically an espresso with a mountain of whipped cream. It fell out of favor in the “skimmed milk era” when the man of style drank lattés.

Recently café owners have noticed a marked increase in people ordering them. Must be because more and more people are going keto.
