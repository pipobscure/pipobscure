> Not too long ago, Bryan Cranston started praising the iPad Air for Apple, comparing it to a simple pencil in the company’s last ad. Now, Apple is drawing on Robin William’s performance in Dead Poets Society to create an air of inspiration and creativity around the tablet. Titled Your Verse, the clip looks to make Whitman’s O Me! O Life! the focal point of the campaign, and includes stories from other people using the Air out in the world. 

Which reminds me of another awesome movie to put on my rewatch list.
