# Pebble decided to become spammers rather than makers

I have just received an e-mail from [Pebble](https://getpebble.com) (their Pebble-Info list) and am really disappointed in them as a company.

I backed them during their Kickstater project. The Pebble-Info newsletters have so far always been about directly Pebble related products, such as new apps or watch-faces. Today’s email however promoted all kinds of junk from third parties. It’s obvious, that they have sold out and are now sending spam to their subscribers.

And that makes me really disappointed in them as a company. They should focus on their core strengths (awesome products) rather than sell out their customers.
