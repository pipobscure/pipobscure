title: "> Mary Somerville is the reason for the word ‘scientist.’ A self-taught
  mathematician, astronomer, and physicist, she was a master of connecting the
  physical sciences. In 1834, she’d impressed a historian who found himself
  unable to publicly praise her because the only common description for that
  sort of scholar was ‘man of science.’ He then coined the term ‘scientist’- but
  it wasn’t intended to be a gender-neutral noun, it was specifically a
  reference to Mary Somerville’s
  expertise. [Source](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00033796200202\
