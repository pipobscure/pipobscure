[Lorelei by Scorpions on Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/track/6mwS9ssEVKK7dmVVXwpbv7)

Still an absolutely beautiful ballad. It sounds kind of down, but when you listen to the lyrics itâ€™s all the confidence gained from overcoming treacherous obstacles.

(BTW: Lorelei is a legendary cliff in the Rhine river, that has cost a lot of ships. It looks nice so navigators tended to underestimate the danger.)
