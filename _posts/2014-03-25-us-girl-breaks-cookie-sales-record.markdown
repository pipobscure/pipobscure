[US girl breaks cookie-sales record](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-26733757?utm\_source=nextdraft&utm\_medium=email)

Iâ€™m more impressed by the girl from San Franisco. After all the girl from Oklahoma just put in hard work (i.e. selling a box to everyone she meets) while the girl from San Francisco actually had smarts and decided to fill a specific need that was under served. She actually put smarts into her sales strategy.
