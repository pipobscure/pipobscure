It’s not an issue, it’s fucking funny!  
I mean look at her face looking scared at her wrist.

However it is an issue, because cartoons teach boys and girls about how their bodies should look. It’s a subconscious thing but as a child you pick up clues from everything you see. What is Disney teaching my daughter with this way to caricature gender differences? I don’t know the answer, but it definitely bears thinking about.
