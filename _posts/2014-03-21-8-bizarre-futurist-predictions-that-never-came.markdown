[8 Bizarre Futurist Predictions That Never Came True](http://mashable.com/2014/03/19/false-future-predictions/)

1.  Say goodbye to the letters C, X and Q  
    Well we still have those, but the predicted “spelling by sound” and “shortening of words” has actually happened _LOL_
2.  Flying bicycles mean empty cities  
    Well we don’t have flying bicycles, but the real prediction was that there was ubiquitous personal transportation. And that has occurred. Everyone has a car, a lot of people have moved out of the cities and some cities like London or San Francisco are becoming so expensive that the are “reserved for business”
3.  Everything will be coated in plastic, and food comes in frozen bricks  
    While the details of the cleanup process aren’t there (yet?), everthing is covered in plastic.
4.  3D television, complete with “smellevision”  
    We do have 3D TVs and we found that we really don’t want _smellevision_ because really acting is a sweaty business.
5.  Space travel for all  
    Not quite yet “for all”, but we are getting there.
6.  Underground homes, with automated kitchens  
    “Men will continue to withdraw from nature in order to create an environment that will suit them better” as if that isn’t spot on.
7.  Communal showers for hippie homes  
    All I have to say is _fitness club_.
8.  Colonies on the moon, of course  
    Well this one ain’t happening yet. Like no progress.

I for one think that 7/8 isn’t a list of “False Predictions”
