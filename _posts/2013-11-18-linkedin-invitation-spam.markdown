# LinkedIn Invitation Spam

Dear LinkedIn,

it’s bad enough if someone I barely know wants me to join your totally overrated site and hands you my e-mail address for that purpose. I am punishing people who do so on my own, but if you then keep sending me reminders of this, it’s you being obnoxious.

What you have achieved with this is that I will never ever join LinkedIn for any reason what-so-ever, and that I will start informing people of your obnoxious behaviour.

Please provide a link in you invite e-mails that enable me to inform you never ever to send e-mail ever again.

Kind regards, Philipp Dunkel

P.S.: **I hereby give notice to anyone on the planet of the fact, that if you send me a LinkedIn invite, any relationship we might have had will remain theoretical and I reserve the right to send up to 1e9 e-mails with random content to you, basically sending your mail-program into oblivion.**
