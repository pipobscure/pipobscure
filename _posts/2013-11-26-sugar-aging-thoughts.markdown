[Sugar, aging... thoughts](http://nutrify.tumblr.com/post/68101442507/sugar-aging-thoughts)

> From reading [Gary Taubes’ books](http://amzn.com/1400033462%20) and now [Grain Brain](http://amzn.com/B00BAXFCPO), I have seen a lot of discussion of “advanced glycation end products” ([AGEs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_glycation_end-product)). Glycation means the **addition of a carbohydrate/sugar to a protein** (without an enzyme), lipids (fats), and nucleic acids (DNA, RNA etc) - so a sugar molecule…

What is healthy may well also depend on who you are.

While humans are mostly the same, there are individual differences, and carbohydrate tolerance may be one of them.

The interesting question is whether we need carbs at all. Yes they are one way to supply energy, but so is fat. What else are they good for?

The risk in leaving off carbs isreally missing out on something we currently know too little about. Though my personal dietary experiment suggests that there is nothing to miss.

We, or our great grand children, will find out.
