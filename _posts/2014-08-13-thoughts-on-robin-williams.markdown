Here is a person that suffered throughout his life from depression. Which makes his acting even more impressive since he not just had to act the line, but he also had to act happiness. He did it so well, that you could even see the lighting up if the eyes. But he was ultimately unsuccessful at convincing himself.

The question that I would now ask, now that we are deprived of Robin Williams particular genius, is whether on balance the world is now happier or sadder off as a whole.

Now the answer may seem obvious: we are collectively sad. But I think that this would be the wrong answer.

That is because we can still enjoy the many gifts Robin has given us. There are even some that have not yet been released. On the other hand we now lack the incredible pain and sadness that filled him. By taking that away the world truly has become a happier place.
