Please just call it what it is! It’s scrambled tofu and fried tempeh.

I’m sure it tastes absolutely delicious and would be delirious to be so under it’s own identity.

Calling it “the vegan alternative to eggs and bacon” is like calling women “the dickless alternative to men”. Now while that might be good for a laugh in a certain crowd, I don’t know any women (or real men for that matter) that would appreciate that.

So please call and appreciate things for what they are and not for what they are sort of like. Tofu actually tastes better when you call it tofu and prepare it like tofu.

Remember those early ’90s fake frankfurter sausages made of tofu? They were disgusting! And they were disgusting mainly because they pretended to be sausages. When tofu stopped pretending to be meat, it started to be appreciated.
