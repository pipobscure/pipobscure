Standard reply to Java recruiters
=================================

Hi XXXXXX,

  

thanks for getting in touch, but from what you have written, I don’t think these roles are for me.

  

I would like to give you a piece of information though, which may help you to target your approaches better:

  

Java and JavaScript have as much in common as Horse & Horseradish. So if you are looking for a Jokey, approaching someone whose resume screams “tangy roots” will line you up for an eye-watering disappointment.

  

To remain inside the metaphor: if you ever happen to be in search of someone to make a great accompaniment to salmon, please feel free to get in touch.

  

Best regards,
