Tennant was fantastic and a brilliant Doctor, but there wouldn’t _be_ a Tennant Doctor without Eccleston’s Doctor. The way Tennant’s Doctor was portrayed was the _effect_ that Rose had on Nine. In the beginning, Nine was harsh and unforgiving having come back from the Time War, his time with Rose softened that harsh attitude and it’s really shown in this episode.

I repeat: I love Dr. Who even though it’s been going down-hill ever since Ecclestone/Piper. Those two represent to me the essence of modern Who.
