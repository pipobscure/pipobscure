In fact, a gun is several hundred pounds each due to you needing to have a separate license for each one. Then you also need to have it where no one could accidentally find it and if anyone apart from you knows where the gun is, you lose your license and gun. I think it has to be locked up in a position no one will ever find it in.

It getâ€™s even worse. This is in Britain; the preferred weapon when kids play cops & robbers is a bloody whistle! They donâ€™t even think about a gun unless they are playing America.

So this kid goes to a wizarding school; one would think this kid wouldnâ€™t even want to get a gun. Instead that kid would opt for some truly terrifying magical weapon.

So sorry, but this head-cannon cannot work. ðŸ˜€
