> i’m saying that if my bra is being undone before my clothes have even came off then the sex is going to be rushed and therefore probably a shitty one-sided affair, don’t get me wrong if it’s heated in the moment ripping a bra off can be sexy but i’m saying more men need to appreciate it, lingerie is designed to make us feel sexy and for men to be turned on by it, so why aren’t men using it to their advantage and spending some time appreciating that our boobs look great in bras and letting it give them that extra thrill.. 

and I’m saying, that men are like little boys: we want our presents. and while I empathize with the feeling, most of us are way too simple to get any extra thrills.

(now I’m being intentionally obstinate. happens when little boys are confronted with the fact that the girl in the conversation is actually right)
