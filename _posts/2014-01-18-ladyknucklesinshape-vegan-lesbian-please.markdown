title: I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. The alternative to testing on
  animals is either testing on societies “undesireables” (that means, the
  elderly, poor, inmates and more) or no testing at all (which means live
  testing ob you and me). I personally think I’d rather have them test on
  animals so long as there is such a chance of injury. Yeah it’s cruel, but
  life’s a bitch.

> Damn that’s a lot. Now where the list of people who don’t test on animals?

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. The alternative to testing on animals is either testing on societies “undesireables” (that means, the elderly, poor, inmates and more) or no testing at all (which means live testing ob you and me). I personally think I’d rather have them test on animals so long as there is such a chance of injury. Yeah it’s cruel, but life’s a bitch.
