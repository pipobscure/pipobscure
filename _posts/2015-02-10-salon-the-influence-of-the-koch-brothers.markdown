title: This is a perfect example of a coherent migration policy. If you want to
  eliminate those pesky Mexican immigrants, you simply have to lower the
  expected living standards if they come to below what they’d have in Mexico. If
  you keep it up you’ll have to build that wall after all; to keep your fruit
  pickers and gardeners from fleeing to seek a more prosperous life in Mexico.
