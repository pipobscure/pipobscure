Home made Irish Cream:

*   double shot of Whiskey
*   real vanilla
*   Â½ egg yolk
*   cream
*   a dash or two of stevia

Mix together everything except the cream and shake vigorously. Add the cream and keep shaking like a madman. When nice and smooth, enjoy.

The egg yolk is used as an emulsifier, which keeps the whiskey and the cream together. While raw eggs might be a problem for some, this is harmless, because you are first putting it into the whiskey and that kills off anything except an Irishman :)

P.S.: This batch was inspired by and drunken in tribute to [gettingskinnyinamerica](http://gettingskinnyinamerica.tumblr.com/)
