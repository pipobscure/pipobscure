Is there a call-center-script that says **_“If a customer wants to get information on how to give us money, pretend to be a complete nit-wit”_** ?

If not, I just spoke to the dumbest ever agent. I mean this woman was risking her life speaking to me, because to get the phone to her ear she had to take out the headphones telling her to breathe.

She honestly answered my question on how to purchase an upgraded calling plan with: **_“Sorry sir, I am not permitted to give out that information due to the data-protection act.”_**

On one hand that make me really want to be their customer, because if they are so worried about data-protection, that they wont tell me how to give them more money, I feel my data is going to be really safe. On the other hand **_that’s just bloody stupid_**, which is not an attribute I value in a company that I want to provide me with a complex technological service such as mobile phone service.
