For the first time in history the U.S. Has something resembling a health care system worthy of a civilised nation and they have nothing better to do than complain about that very fact.

Just give it 50 years and Obama will be categorised together with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln as one of the greatest presidents in history.

Children will learn in school:

\- Washington brought freedom to half the population  
\- Abraham Lincoln to the other half  
\- Obama made sure they enjoyed that freedom in good health
