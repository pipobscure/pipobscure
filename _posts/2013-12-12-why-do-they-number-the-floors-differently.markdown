# Why do they number the floors differently?

Iâ€™m hanging out in Budapest for the weekend. While in the hotel elevator, I overheard this American couple asking the same stupid question that every American that leaves her country for the first time asks:

_Why do they number the floors differently?_

After I resisted the urge to scream and explain the concept of cultural and linguistic differences to them, I decided to write a short post with the actual boring explanation:

In most European languages, the word for _floor_ does not mean the same exact thing. Instead the French word _etage_ or the German _Stock_ actually mean something like _added level_. So of course the _first added level_ is the not the _ground level_ but the one above.

So simple and yet it has challenged travellers for ages.
