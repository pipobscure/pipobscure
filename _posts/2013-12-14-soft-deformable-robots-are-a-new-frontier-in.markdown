[Soft, Deformable Robots Are A New Frontier In Robotics](http://www.fastcompany.com/3022517/fast-feed/soft-deformable-robots-are-a-new-frontier-in-robotics)

> Robot octopi are slithering into existence. Quick, picture a robot. You’re probably thinking of a talking pile of tin cans, or maybe some hard-shelled Roomba-like object on wheels. But engineers are coming alive to the possibilities of robotics fashioned of flexible polymers, powered by pneumatics and electric currents, that move as delicately and flexibly as an octopus or a worm.

Takes all the realism out of shooting tin cans. How the hell is a guy supposed to get his dose of Terminator exercise now?
