title: "> Coffee Seeks Its Own Level. 1990. If one person alone lifts his cup,
  coffee overflows the other three cups. All four people need to coordinate
  their actions and lift simultaneously. Inspired by the principle “water seeks
  its own level”. I had been working on a series of projects using basic
  scientific principles learned in high school as a means to explore
  architectural issues."
