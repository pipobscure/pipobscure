[SPLC complaint: Cultural exchange students in South Carolina exploited for cheap labor](https://www.splcenter.org/news/2016/07/27/splc-complaint-cultural-exchange-students-south-carolina-exploited-cheap-labor)

The complaint is entirely without merit. As a matter of fact one could state that these exchange students have been among the few privileged enough to actually see American culture in all its glory:

*   full on capitalism
*   social irresponsibility
*   benefits for the few at the cost of the many
*   exploitation of workers (especially when black or brown)

Nothing un-American here.
