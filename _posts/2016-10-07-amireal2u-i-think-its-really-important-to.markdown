> I think it’s really important to understand when someone says “Voting for Trump is going to kill people” they don’t mean that as soon as he’s sworn in, we’ll suddenly be transported into 1930s Europe with the gestapo coming around to round up the “Bad People” so they can be categorized and placed in the proper ghetto/camp.

> Do you remember that article about England’s new disability laws that suddenly declared a large chunk of people capable of work based on absolutely no medical recommendation at all? And how six months later the suicide rates had spiked within that community?

> That’s what we mean. Slowly, all of the things society has put into place to help people will dry up. Disability allowances, at risk teen hotlines and programs, pre natal care for the poor, all of those things that quite frankly barely make a drop in the budget but still manage to save lives will start to dry up. Right around the time an inevitable rise in violent hate crimes and non violent denials of human rights (worse than it is now) and slowly, ever so slowly, you will stop being able to talk about things.

> And we **will** die. Either through neglect or our own hands. But we WILL die. And you won’t know it because no one will talk about it. One day you’ll look up and there will be another hole where an entire generation has been ripped away from life for no other reason than being who they were.
