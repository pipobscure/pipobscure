# Reminder to self: do not buy vodaphone

Bought a Vodaphone sim-card for data and loaded it up with 3GB. After like 300MB it asked me to load it up again. The people at the Vodaphone shop were the most unhelpful ever, claiming I had used up my 3GB, which is ridiculous, since it had literally been 15 minutes of use. 3GB in 15 minutes? That’s some impressive HSDPA speed there.

What did i learn? Don’t get stuff from vodaphone.
