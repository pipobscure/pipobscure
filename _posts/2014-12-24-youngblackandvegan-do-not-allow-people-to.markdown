> Do not allow people to mispronounce your name.

Why ever not? This isn’t really an issue is it? I’m your average white male, yet my name has been mispronounced so often that I don’t recall the last time it wasn’t.

Now if they then say something like “Oh I can’t pronounce that I’ll just call you <insert-short-Anglo-name-here>” then yeah. Kill them!
