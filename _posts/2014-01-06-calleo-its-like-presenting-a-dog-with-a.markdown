> Well.

> I presented my two dogs with an actual sirloin steak, then told them no.
> 
> Woofles didn’t even approach it when I set it down, as I hadn’t told him it was okay to do so.  
> Quinn approached it, completely ready to take it from the plate (as her manners are not yet as good as Woofles’ manners), was told no, and immediately backed off.
> 
> When Woofles heard the no, he turned away as well because he knew that steak was not for him to eat.
> 
> **Notice how they didn’t ‘argue’, didn’t take it anyway, didn’t get aggressive, didn’t beg, or didn’t try to somehow persuade me that they should be able to have it.**
> 
> **They were told no, they backed off.**
> 
> So, essentially, if you use that analogy to excuse rape, you’re saying you have _less_ self control and _fewer_ basic social manners than my two dogs.
