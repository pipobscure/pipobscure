# weight is relative

I had a funky experience today. I only weigh myself only once every month and a half, because I believe that the scale is not a good tool for measuring progress.

Today I weighed in at more than last time around, at the same time, I am wearing one waist size smaller than the last time as well. The only way this is possible is that I managed to convert a bunch of fat into muscle.

If I only took weight as a measurement, then I’d be quite depressed now. After all I gained over the last month and a half. But then if I look at the whole picture I feel awesome. After all, I didn’t really notice gaining muscle until this.

(I guess working out an hour and a half workout 4-5 times a week does pay off. Yeah!!!)
