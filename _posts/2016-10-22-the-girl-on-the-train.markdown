[The Girl on the Train](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/0552779776/ref=mp\_s\_a\_1\_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1477161605&sr=8-1&pi=AC\_SX236\_SY340\_QL65&keywords=the+girl+on+the+train&dpPl=1&dpID=41iogQRn2jL&ref=plSrch)

This is a must read book. It’s an absolutely brilliant story that is all to realistic.

Don’t wait for the film; this story works in London, but I don’t think it works in New York. If a producer has to call up the author to ask “Are G&T premixed in a can a thing?” Then you know you have hit on one of these cultural differences. And if the fact that the protagonist is a drunk is central to the plot then that cultural difference is key.

I found this book so incredibly realistic and depressing, because I can picture it taking place in real life.
