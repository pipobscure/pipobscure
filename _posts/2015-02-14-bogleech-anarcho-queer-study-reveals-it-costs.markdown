Housing these people led to dramatic cost savings that more than paid for the cost of putting them in decent housing, including $1.8 million in health care savings from 447 fewer ER visits (78% reduction) and 372 fewer hospital days (79% reduction). Tenants also spent 84 fewer days in jail, with a 72% drop in arrests.

The remainder of the $14,000 per tenant annually is covered by donations and local and federal funding. **According to the [UNCC study](http://www.nchousing.org/annual-conference/past-conferences/2013-conference/2013-workshops/presentations/301b/caroline-chambre.pdf), that $14,000 pales in comparison to the costs a chronically homeless person racks up every year to society — a stunning $39,458 in combined medical, judicial and other costs.**

One year after move-in, they’re up to 82%. And after an average length of 7 years of homelessness, 94% of the original tenants retained their housing after 18 months, with a 99% rent collection rate.

A [2011 report](http://www.amstat.org/sections/srms/proceedings/y2011/Files/400188.pdf) commissioned by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority found that people have condescending attitudes towards the homeless, with **the public perceiving higher levels of substance abuse problems (91%) and mental health issues (85%) than reported by the homeless themselves (41% and 24% respectively)**. It concluded that if “_personal failings as the main cause of homelessness, it is unlikely that they will vote for increased public assistance or volunteer to help the homeless themselves._”
