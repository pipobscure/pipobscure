> 100% of people who tell you you’re too sensitive are saying it because they don’t want to be held responsible for your reaction when they mistreat you

Actually that’s wrong. It might well be your doctor explaining to you whan an **allergy** is. ([See Hypersensitivity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity), which is what _too sensitive_ means.)
