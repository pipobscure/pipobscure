[Wake Up Tiger: Are You Living Your Résumé or Your Eulogy?](http://wakeuptiger.blogspot.com/2013/09/are-you-living-your-resume-or-your.html)

The hypothesis being that living your eulogy is superior and living your resume is a failure. Maybe we are just doing eulogies wrong. Maybe eulogies should not be about “how human” the deceased was.

It may not be

> His crowning achievement was when he made Sales Director.

but rather

> he strived and dreamed of becoming Sales Director, and he had enough gumption to actually make it.

maybe it shouldn’t be:

> We especially remember him as a person who had a MBA.

but maybe it should be:

> He had an awesome education and put it to good use.

Maybe we should rethink how we do eulogies. I for one am rather sick of going to funerals and hearing what a great human the deceased was, when he was a complete tosser and a waste of oxygen. Maybe we should hold eulogies about the impact the person had on their surroundings rather than nice sounding platitudes.

It’s very easy to claim it may be a better world if we all went after the platitudes, but it would be a desperately depressing world as well. I would rather celebrate someone for being an _inspiring asshat_ than a depressing _good human being_.
