    <p>I’ve received the following from thd Scout Association.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>Dear all,</p>

<p>Many of you will have seen the media reports about the possible removal of the statue of Robert Baden-Powell, the Founder of the global Scout movement, from Poole Quay, in Dorset.</p>

<p>The intention, we understand, is to avoid damage to the statue as the important debate continues around the role of historical figures, following Black Lives Matters protests across the world. This is a vital moment to have honest conversations, acknowledge the huge strength of feeling and renew our commitment to education and understanding with empathy and humility.</p>

<p>As Scouts we stand together against racism, always. Inclusion and acceptance are at the heart of our values, and we are not afraid to call out racist language or behaviour.</p>

<p>We strongly support the principles of Black Lives Matter and also stand with those affected by racism. We are a movement that inspires openness, kindness, understanding and the power of community and friendship.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1907, a new movement was born on Brownsea Island, in Poole harbour Dorset – one that would bring skills, kindness and courage to millions around the world.  It was here that Robert Baden-Powell founded the Scouts by taking a small group of young people from diverse backgrounds to live and work together. Their aim was to learn about the great outdoors, work in teams, and show we had more in common than divides us.  Since that first camp, Scouting has grown, year on year, to become today a worldwide family, some 54 million strong, in almost every nation on earth. It is, without doubt, one of the greatest youth movements in history.</p>

<p>But it’s right that we make time to listen, educate ourselves, and reflect on history - acknowledging where there are times when views and actions from the past do not match those values we live by today. It’s also right that we do not make any accusations or form any conclusions without the facts. These are the foundations of an open and honest debate about our society’s past and future.</p>

<p>Baden-Powell was a complex figure, with changing and sometimes contradictory views that often reflected his time. We would never attempt to defend or agree with everything he did or said. However it’s obvious from the last 100 years, that Scouts has the power to unite people in a spirit of mutual friendship and respect and has become the greatest youth movement the world has ever seen.</p>

<p>For generations, the Scout movement has brought millions of young people together from different cultures and backgrounds to promote friendship, cooperation and understanding. This happens at a community level across the UK, and at a global level at World Scout Jamborees and international camps. We are proud to build bridges between communities.</p>

<p>As a movement, we’re also proud to support young people from every community in the UK, helping them develop values of integrity, respect, belief, care and cooperation.</p>

<p>To actively support our members, <a href="https://scouts-news.org.uk/31ME-11PBN-3DE29G-NLRGJ-1/c.aspx">we have created and shared guidance and resources to help parents and volunteers</a> to have conversations about racism with young people.  This is a first step in helping give our members the skills, confidence and courage to challenge racism and other behaviours that go against our values as Scouts.</p>

<p>To be clear, there is no place for prejudice or discrimination of any kind in Scouts. Instead we actively celebrate the diversity of our members’ backgrounds, talents, thought and abilities that makes Scouting the vibrant community it is today.</p>

<p>As Scouts, we must all continue to listen and reflect on how we live up to our values and strive to do better.</p>

<p>Thank you for your own example, living and sharing our values.</p>

    <h1 id="why-im-wavering-on-brexit">Why I’m wavering on Brexit</h1>

<p>There is no doubt in my mind that Brexit will be severely negative for Britain, both as a country and for the majority of its population. However recently I’ve come to doubt that Brexit is an overall bad thing and am coming to toy with the thought that Brexit might be the best thing to happen and the harder the better. Let me explain why that is.</p>

<p>To do that, I believe I have to explain a bit about me:</p>

<p>I am a European and hold EU nationality. I am not a British citizen and have no vote in general elections in the UK. I do however live in London and hold down a good job that put’s me - according to HMRC - in the top 5% by annual income and also provides additional private health insurance. I own my own home and several other assets, so neither my short-term nor long-term prosperity are in much doubt Brexit or no Brexit. I am also very socially liberal and quite metropoilitan so when the term “liberal metropolitan elite” is voiced I can only say “that’s me and I’m proud of it”. Beside that I am white and male and speak English to a level that most Brits or Americans can only aspire to and with an accent that most Brits would place in America or Canada, while most Americans would place in Britain. In short racism, xenophobia, misogyny or need are not problems I am facing or am ever likely to face. In short I live what must objectively called a very privileged life though not on the level of a Warren Buffet or even a Jacob Rees-Mogg. Politically I am probably most inline with - as a short-hand description - the Liberal Democrats, although I’d be more on the left of that movement and can sympathise with many but not all of the ideas that Labour promotes. I believe we should have a strong health-care for everyone and excellent education across the board to the extent that Eton goes broke because the public education is of such quality that stingy Tories see it as a waste of money. I also believe that as a society we have an obligation to take care of our weakest members so that food-banks or homeless shelters should simply not exist.</p>

<p>Given that position in life, I have a divided view on Brexit.</p>

<p>On the one hand as an inhabitant of the United Kingdom I cannot want Brexit because it would or will be an absolute disaster for this ountry and this society. But it is something that Britons have chosen and gotten themselves into. As a liberal, who am I to proscribe the path this country chooses?</p>

<p>On the other hand I am a European. There is little doubt in my mind that Brexit has significanlty assisted in stabilizing the European Union. Brexit has made it clear to all members that the EU is the only hope Europe has for a prosperous and relevant future. It has also caused the European Union to speak with one voice for the first time in a long while. In addition with Brexit the EU is excorporating one of the key blockers to a closer political union. Britain is certainly not alone in blocking further political union, but it is by far the strongest proponent; to the degree that the others such as Hungary are highly unlikely to be able to sway the EU as a whole in the future.</p>

<p>This ever closer union, is both necessary for EU stability and for achieving the relevance on the global stage that Europe could have and wants to have. And if that closer union proceeds, I foresee the opportunity to have a strong core of the EU, which would exclude countries like Hungary, Norway, Poland and Switzerland. This core would form a federal entity. On the periphery there could form a collaborative free trade block that includes the current EU members that are not part of the core and makes room for countries like Turkey which are economically aligned but politcally too far away from European ideals. This outer group would also have room for a future Britain (whether with Scotland, Wales &amp; Northern Ireland or without).</p>

<p>In short I can see Brexit as an opportunity for the European Union to progress and strengthen itself; and as a European this prospect is not unappealing albeit at the cost of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>At the same time while this scenario would be an incredible boon to the EU it would be disastrous for Britain. The income gap in this country would open up even further, many people would suffer and slide into destitution, the health-service would potentially collapse and people would die. All off this is already beginning to happen and Brexit achieved would only exacerbate the situation. I cannot in good conscience advocate for such an outcome. I don’t however have a vote; and Britons seem hell-bent on self-imolation by electing a Tory government certain to take them down this path.</p>

<p>So I am left to hope for a Labour majority (however unlikely this seems at the moment) and a Labour Brexit (with a customs union and single market membership) winning overwhelmingly in a second referendum. That way I might get a Brexit boon for the EU with at least limited damage to the UK; and the damage to the UK would at least be handled by a government that knows that compassion is a word.</p>

    <h1 id="consensus-driven-decision-making">Consensus Driven Decision Making</h1>

<p>Open collaboration groups tend to strive for consensus in their decisions. Consensus as an ideal is a worthwhile goal because it allows for all participants to have a direct influence on the decisions and therefore fosters participation and values the participants. However seeking consensus can also lead to a lack of progress because individual voices have the ability to block all progress.</p>

<p>When we created CAcert, a community CA, we realized that this was not a sustainable model. So we decided to borrow the concept of “rough consensus” from the IETF and adapt it to our needs. This has served CAcert well and has been the single best model for collaborative group management I have yet encountered.</p>

<p>To quote the <a href="http://wiki.cacert.org/Policy/Guide">CAcert Wiki</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rough consensus is somewhere between a unanimous acceptance, and a clear super-majority. A simple majority vote of 51% is not sufficient, and a 100% vote is not required.</p>

  <p>In practice this means that all criticisms must be addressed sufficiently to be satisfied that all have had a fair say. But it also recognises that there will always be some who disagree. Perfect is the enemy of the good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This method allows for votes as an indication mechanism to determine the level of agreement that has been reached without the presumtion that a majority of any type will be sufficient to pass the decision. Even a single voice may suffice to indicate a lack of rough consensus. Which leads to the question of how a group can determine that rough consensus has been reached.</p>

<p>The interesting answer is that this can be decided using rough consensus. The group can take indicative votes at any time both on the matter at hand itself or on whether rough consensus has been reached. Presuming honest dealing among participants, the vote indication on the matter could be significantly different from the vote indication whether rough consensus has been reached.</p>

<p>As a practical matter if the answer to the question what would need to change about the proposal to reach unanimous consensus is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>nothing</li>
  <li>any changes made would not increase the level of consent</li>
</ol>

<p>The first would be an indication that there are simply some whose objections are systemic rather than matter specific; this means there is rough consensus and the decision should be passed.</p>

<p>The second case could be an indication that there are simply factual incompatibilities leading to two mutually exclusive choices that can never be reconciled. In this case an indicative vote can be taken whether rough consensus has been achieved or whether an entirely new approach needs to be discovered and proposed.</p>

<p>In short this methodology allows for effective consensus driven decision making without the detrimental elements of requiring unanimity. While this model may not fit every possible situation, it served very well so far and can only be recommended as a general modus operandi.</p>

    <h1 id="im-not-a-fan-of-democracy">I’m not a fan of democracy</h1>

<p>Now that I have that inflammatory statement out of the way let me explain what I mean by it. Democracy is defined as the rule of the entirety by a majority of its constituents. If that majority is sufficiently large or the options are sufficiently close that may be acceptable. However if either the options are diametrically opposed or the majority is rather small (or worse both at the same time) this turns into oppression of the minority by the majority.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact that was the reason why James Maddison advocated for a republic rather than a democracy in his Federalist Papers. He knew in the 18th century that in a pure democracy there was a real risk of the majority faction acting counter to the interests of a large minority or even the interest of the entirety.</p>

<p>No system has demonstrated the truth of this better than the United Kingdom’s form of first past the post democracy combined with democratic referendums. And no historic event demonstrates this better than the referendum on leaving the European Union.</p>

<p>In the Brexit referendum 52% of all votes cast voted to leave and 48% voted to remain. If one takes voter turnout into account that means that a majority faction of 37% voted for Brexit. While that result means there is (or at least was) a majority for Brexit, it also means that 37% of the population are now forcing their will on the 63% who did not vote for Brexit. On the other hand, just remaining is not a viable option either since that, by the same logic, would mean that 34% would force their will to remain on 66% of the people.</p>

<p>The solution to this conundrum is not ignore expressions of voter preferences, but rather to stop worshipping at the altar of pure democracy and majority rule.</p>

<p>As I said above, pure majority rule democracy of the flavour so popular in the UK leads to chaos and oppression whenever the options are diametrically opposed or the majority is small. In the case of Brexit both are the case.The solution is to accept that democracy is not the answer to running a country. Instead we should take our lead from the American founding fathers like James Madison. We should strive to establish a form of government that balances the wishes of the majority with those of the minority. Abolishing first past the post is a first step. Electing multiple MPs per constituency who are chosen by proportional voting would be an important step which would also counter gerrymandering. Requiring supermajorities for all referendums and many issues decided in parliament might be an additional safeguard.</p>

<p>Whatever the UK decides to do going forward, we need to acknowledge that its form of democracy has failed to serve the entirety of its people and caused a painful division in the country that may take decades to heal.</p>
