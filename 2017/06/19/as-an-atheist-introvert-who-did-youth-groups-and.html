        <p><strong><em>Question:</em></strong> As an atheist introvert who did youth groups and was even an altar server of the Roman Catholic variety… I can sympathize SO. HARD.</p>

<p><strong><em>Answer:</em></strong> I WAS ALSO AN ALTAR SERVER. I was pretty good at it- I was the only kid in the parish who didn’t pretend to get high whenever they were serving with the incense, so that was always my job at the masses where it was used. Until I almost killed the bishop. Then, for some reason, they didn’t let me serve anymore…</p>
