 * [… sometimes I just get frustrated at the sheer abundance of self loathing on tumblr and the whining it leads to, especially when it’s self evident. Yeah, sexism exists. You don’t need to reiterate that. No one with even half a brain-cell will deny it. Just look around; there is a plethora of evidence. sigh I guess that was just one inane feminist post too many. I’ll go to sleep now and I’ll be all better in the morning.](86340960339.md)
 * [Stop saying sorry. Say thank you instead. When you say, “sorry for being a jerk” the other person is forced to either call you a jerk or say it wasnt a big deal. Instead, say “thank you for being so patient with me” so the other person has a reason to say they love you.](87169210258.md)
