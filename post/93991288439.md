****** Me during the entire months of summer: sleep, eat, television, video games, don't see sunlight for 3 daysEveryone else in one day of summer: went to the moon, fell in love, traveled to france, met obama, kissed lance bass, starred in a porn, got a tattoo, rode a giraffe ***undefined*** Actually you are confusing Facebook with Real-Life. These "others" are just as boring, they're just better at posting.
