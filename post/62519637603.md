title: It seems that there are still some like the LAUSD that have not realised yet, that you cannot lock down technology and still expect it to be useful. The LA-Times reported that LAUSD halts home use of iPads for students, which might just be the silliest thing to it could do. The one thing sillier is to truly believe that it could prevent this to begin with. But aside from all that, there is a much deeper question that should be raised. That is not &ldquo;can we prevent students from surfing the net&rdquo;, but &ldquo;should we prevent students from surfing the net&rdquo;. As has been previously discussed in what inner city kids know about social media kids don&rsquo;t really need to be protected from the internet by people that know less about it than they do. We (and the LAUSD) should be proud that students circumvented the stupid restrictions so quickly and commend them for it. They should also not restrict students use of the tools that they were given. The LAUSD should be embarrassed by all of this. Not that their security measures where circumvented, but rather that they thought they were warranted and their reaction to the circumvention. Maybe the people at the LAUSD should be sent back to school; obviously they are not yet ready for the 21st century.
