title: I just heard the most cogent pro-choice argument by Kate Smurthwaite. She argues that even if a fetus is accepted to be a full human life, if a woman is asked to supply the use of her own anatomy to another being that is (or at least should be) her choice. This argument finally is a cogent argument that the time of the abortion or when life actually starts is totally irrelevant. Finally someone is arguing in a way that eliminates the tedious discussion on when life begins. And it&rsquo;s finally an argument that, while we men may want to educate ourselves about the issues and be as supportive as we can be, our opinion on abortion is (or at least should be) ultimately irrelevant.
