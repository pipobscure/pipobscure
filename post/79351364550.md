<p>mishasminions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I REALLY LIKE THIS URBAN LEGEND BEHIND THE WORD, <strong>&ldquo;FUCK&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>THAT SAID THAT IN THE MIDDLE AGES, DURING THE BLACK DEATH, RESOURCES WERE SCARCE SO COUPLES HAD TO OBTAIN ROYAL PERMISSION TO HAVE CHILDREN</p>
<p>SO THEY HAD TO PUT UP A SIGN ON THEIR HOUSE (VISIBLE ON THE ROAD) THAT SAID,</p>
<p>“<strong>F</strong>ORNICATION <strong>U</strong>NDER <strong>C</strong>ONSENT of <strong>K</strong>ING”</p>
<p>AND THEIR ENTIRE STREET WOULD KNOW THEY’RE FUCKING</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of the few things of note my father taught me.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>The word &ldquo;fuck&rdquo; did not originate in Christianized Anglo-Saxon England as an acronym of &ldquo;Fornication Under Consent of King&rdquo; - It is of Proto-Germanic origin, and is related to Dutch fokken and Norwegian fukka.</blockquote>
