<p>My wife never used to wear nail polish. One of her reasons was that she disliked doing her nails, because she always messed up.</p>

<p>Then about 5 years ago, I did my own nails with black polish for my ghoul costume. Thing is, I was quicker and the results were better. Now she wears nail polish more often and I get to spend my evenings and weekends doing her nails.</p>

<p>I guess it&rsquo;s true what they say: never let anyone see you having skills at something you do not absolutely live doing, or you&rsquo;ll be doing it for the rest of your life.</p>
