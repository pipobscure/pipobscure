 * [I recently met @davglass at NodeConf.eu. … Before I get started let me use this space to give a shoutout to @Cianomaidin of nearform for putting on one of the best conferences ever. … anyhow i met this yahoo and he was really bubbling over about the products of this internet dinosaur Yahoo!. (Love bad puns) While Yahoo! hasn’t really been the company I would associate with the word “innovative” over the last couple of years, it is a pretty cool story. An internet methusalem, that is pretty spry for its age that is actually still doing pretty cool stuff. (For details about alcoholic software please speak to @davglass) So I decided to give Yahoo! another shot at getting integrated into my personal toolset. I will write down here every once in a while how the experience goes, but so far i like it. Yahoo-Mail is a much better fit for how i use E-Mail than GMail ever was. I just had a look at Yahoo-Groups and will try to organize the Viennese NodeJS community using it. In short, I like what i am seeing. @davglass is an awesome ambassador for Yahoo!

 * [Yahoo! by eric hayes, on Flickr About a month ago I wrote my first post here entitled Giving Yahoo! another shot. Now it’s time to look back over the last month and record an update of how it went. TL;DR I’m both impressed and disappointed. It’s a love/hate relationship, but the love outweighs the hate by at least 2](64869804530.md)
