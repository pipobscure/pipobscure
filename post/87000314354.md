<p>look it’s fine if ur not religious omg it’s 100% ok but once u start telling people that their prayers are worthless, that God isn’t listening, that He is imaginary, that Jesus didn’t exist, that their religious texts are garbage, etc. then you’re a piece of shit shut up</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s fine if you are religious. In fact it&rsquo;s 100% Ok. But the moment you tell someone that they&rsquo;ll go to hell or that your faith is the only true one or that laws should be made in accordance to what your imaginary friend supposedly wants, you become an inexcusable asshole.</p>
