title: After I read @maxogden&rsquo;s tweet I was debating whether I really wanted to respond. Especially because this cartoon about these conversations (thanks @izs for tweet) does have some truth to it. However, I feel that there is a point that is being missed. We are all human beings first. If we create an environment where another human being feels unwelcome or uncomfortable, or worse threatened, that is a problem. For this to be a problem it does not matter one bit whether that person be female, male, cis-, trans- or whichever label you want to apply. It matters solely that a potential member of our community does not feel welcome. One consequence of having created such an environment is the sprouting of sub-groups reserved for the sub-members that carry some sub-label or other. And that in turn is the official certificate of community failure. So while having a girls night out with your node friends might be a valuable experience for a female noder (just as a stereotypical example), it should definitely not become a thing simply because it means that the node community has failed so badly that it has to be separated along more or less arbitrary gender lines. To me that&rsquo;s not not about discrimination against men or any such non-sense. It&rsquo;s about failing to provide a community where people are respected for who they are and what they bring to the table. So rather than advocating Non-Binary-Node groups we should be working diligently on making our community one that does not need those sub-groups. So if Max Ogden&rsquo;s female friend is learning ruby rather than node because ruby has all these &ldquo;women in ruby&rdquo; groups, we should make the the effort of telling people, that they should learn node, because we have all those &ldquo;humans in node&rdquo; groups. Because that is truly being better rather than &ldquo;no worse than usual&rdquo;.
