<h1>Standard reply to Java recruiters</h1><p>Hi XXXXXX,</p><p><br/></p><p>thanks for getting in touch, but from what you have written, I don’t think these roles are for me.</p><p><br/></p><p>I would like to give you a piece of information though, which may help you to target your approaches better:</p><p><br/></p><p>Java and JavaScript have as much in common as Horse &amp; Horseradish. So if you are looking for a Jokey, approaching someone whose resume screams “tangy roots” will line you up for an eye-watering disappointment.</p><p><br/></p><p>To remain inside the metaphor: if you ever happen to be in search of someone to make a great accompaniment to salmon, please feel free to get in touch.</p><p><br/></p><p>Best regards,</p>
