just-shower-thoughts: When ...

<p>just-shower-thoughts:</p>

<blockquote><p>When i heard that 50% of the people have an IQ below average, i was surprised. Since i needed 1 min to understand that this is simple logic and applies to every statement, i feel like i am one of them.</p></blockquote>

<p>And the sad thing is that it&rsquo;s not even necessarily true. A set of incredibly stupid people could lower the average by enough that more than 50% of all people would be above average intelligence. On the other hand a set of absolute geniuses could raise the average enough for more than 50% to be below average intelligence. But I guess it takes a &ldquo;genius&rdquo; (a.k.a. high-school graduate) to know the difference between median and mean.</p>
