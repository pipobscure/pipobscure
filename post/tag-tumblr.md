# Tag tumblr

 * [Dear Tumblr users who I don’t know in real life, I really like seeing your personal posts, even the whiny angsty ones, and particularly the strange boring ones. I like these little windows into your lives even if I’ve never seen pictures of you and all I really know is that we like a few of the same tv shows. Please continue to let me read your to do lists and your conversations with strange relatives. Thank you, Stranger from the internet.](107543768389.md)

 * [And once again I noticed that I haven’t seen anything from one of my favorite tumblrs in a while. I thought she might me on hiatus and went to her page and guess what! No hiatus, A bunch of good posts that I would have loved to see! Can anyone explain to me why tumblr would go and filter posts from people I actually chose to follow. I mean how strongly do you need me to indicate that this is actually stuff I want to see?](86094989404.md)
