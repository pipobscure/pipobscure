sixpenceee: did you ever be...

<p>sixpenceee:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>did you ever become friends with someone so beautiful?  and then they started telling you about the douchebags in their lives that did horrible things to them, like cheat and lie. and the only thing running through your mind is “who would ever want to hurt someone like you?”</p>
</blockquote>
