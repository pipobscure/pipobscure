astr-odiac: Aries : Remembe...

<p>astr-odiac:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aries : Remember that time I said I thought you were cool? I lied.</p>

<p>Taurus : You only annoy me when you’re breathing, really.</p>

<p>Gemini : Do yourself a favor and ignore anyone who tells you to be yourself. Bad idea in your case.</p>

<p>Cancer: Everyone’s entitled to act stupid once in awhile, but you really abuse the privilege.</p>

<p>Leo : Sometimes it’s better to keep your mouth shut and give the impression that you’re stupid than open it and remove all doubt.</p>

<p>Virgo: Remember when I asked for your opinion? Me neither.</p>

<p>Libra : Do your parents even realize they’re living proof that two wrongs don’t make a right?</p>

<p>Scorpio : Do you ever wonder what life would be like if you’d gotten enough oxygen at birth?</p>

<p>Sagittarius : Are you always such an idiot, or do you just show off when I’m around?</p>

<p>Capricorn : There are some remarkably dumb people in this world. Thanks for helping me understand that.</p>

<p>Aquarius: I could eat a bowl of alphabet soup and shit out a smarter statement than whatever you just said.</p>

<p>Pisces : Some day you’ll go far—and I really hope you stay there.</p>

<p>This is actually the first astrology related post on tumblr that I enjoyed</p>
