Journalists remind us that ...

<p>Journalists remind us that the prime minister is a vicar’s daughter. Looking at her policies, I can only imagine her favourite Bible verse to be Matthew 25:29: “For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.”</p>
