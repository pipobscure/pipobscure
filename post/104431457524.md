title: I have just watched the video of Eric Garner final moments. This is absolutely outrageous. Everyone in the chain of command of these officers from Mayor DeBlasio and Commissioner Bratton on down should immediately resign. They are obviously not fit for their jobs as public servants since they did not straight up fire these officers for cause. Now I get why there might be an element of doubt in some cases, but this was straight up filmed and documented. I also get why there might be legalistic reasons for not charging these officers with a crime, but there is simply no excuse for letting these animals remain on the NYPD.
