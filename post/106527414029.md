I wish I was as talented as...


            ***Question: *** I wish I was as talented as you.

            ***Answer: *** I’m not talented; I spend a lot of time practicing my crafts. I have taken a lot of art classes and drawn excessively since I could hold a pencil. I have been writing to express things I can’t say out loud since I was 14. I have been experimenting with photography constantly for several years now. Talent is the product of passion and determination. If you believe that you lack talent and therefore cannot do something, you will limit yourself indefinitely.
