One billion people are malnourished while one-third of the worldâ€™s arable land is devoted to the production of feed crops for livestock.

            *Source: 20 True Costs of Factory Pig Farming (and lets not forget that the amount we grow is sufficient to feed those one billion people and then some) (via delices-detre-vegetalien) This creates the appearance that if we were to stop farming animals, then those one billon people would have food and not be malnourished. That is pure fantasy; Human beings are not fair; if we stopped animal farming, the western world will come up with other uses for arable land and the crops grown there; anything to prevent feeding the malnourished; they&rsquo;d come up with inventions like fuelling vehicles with crops before even giving the possibility of feeding the world a single thought. I for one will stick with eating meat.*
