Almost half of adults in the U.S. believe in at least one medical conspiracy theory, according to a report by the University of Chicago. Some conspiracy theories are widely held: Some 37% believe that the Food and Drug Administration is purposely concealing information on natural, alternative treatments for cancer, while only a third of respondents said they disagreed with that theory. The most well-known theory was the myth that vaccinations can trigger autistic spectrum disorders, although this theory has been thoroughly debunked by medical researchers. Nearly 70% of the respondents said that they had heard of the theory, while 20% believe it to be true.
