<p>when Carl von Clausewitz (1780-1831) said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>War is the continuation of politics by other means.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I always thought he was being callous about war. Being a Prussian general that assumption is reasonable.</p>

<p>Looking at politics today though I have realised that maybe he was simply saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Politics is just as stupid as war but you donâ€™t get quite as bloody.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or maybe elections in Austria are just depressing.</p>
