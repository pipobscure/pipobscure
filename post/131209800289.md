<p>Had a discussion today with a coworker who had observed me walking through a door, then holding it open for a woman before walking through it first. He called me all kind of uncourteous.</p>

<p>Here is the reason:</p>

<p>If I hold the door for a lady and she goes through first, I&rsquo;ll be behind her. If we then share a stretch of the way, I will be constantly following her. I am one scary looking dude, so the entire time she&rsquo;ll feel the threat of me looming behind her and followinf her.</p>

<p>If on the other hand, I hold the door so that she can follow me through, I&rsquo;m still being nice. However now I&rsquo;m walking in front of her going my way. Since she is the one following (or not), I am no longer perceived as a potential threat.</p>

<p>So ladies, when a man smiles and walks out in front of you, he&rsquo;s not trying to be uncourteous. On the contrary, he may just be making an effort to make you feel at ease and safe.</p>

<p>So guys, think about how you come across. You might think you are being courteous. In reality you are maximising the perceived threat.</p>
