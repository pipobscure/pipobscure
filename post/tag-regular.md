 * [I really don’t want to hear this crap about “race-discrimination”, “rape-culture” and the like any more. I’m a white middle aged male and I’m sick of it! Now before you go all apeshit at me, let me explain what I mean. More than a century ago slaves were freed and it became law that truly all men should be equal. Almost 100 years ago, women got the vote and it was established into law that there is gender equality. About 50 years ago it was reiterated that race should not be a criterion. And in 2014 youths are being shot simply for being black-skinned, women are molested simply for walking down the street, people run scared because their gender identity doesn’t match what some scatterbrained ass thinks it should. I don’t want a world where race is an issue. I don’t want a world where gender is an issue. I don’t want a world where people have to be rightfully scared simply because of who they are. I want a world where race is what it is, an evolutionary characteristic of ones DNA. I want a world where gender is part accident at birth. Where gender identity is truly irrelevant because no one cares what you identify as and just people accept your word for it. Now I realise that this is not the world we live in, but I want it to be the world we strive for. A world where I don’t hear about race-discrimination or rape-culture because there is no such thing. Now until we have such a world keep screaming and protesting and ranting. I might not want to hear it, but we have to hear it if we ever want to get over that crap.](103741742259.md)
 * [I have just watched the video of Eric Garner final moments. This is absolutely outrageous. Everyone in the chain of command of these officers from Mayor DeBlasio and Commissioner Bratton on down should immediately resign. They are obviously not fit for their jobs as public servants since they did not straight up fire these officers for cause. Now I get why there might be an element of doubt in some cases, but this was straight up filmed and documented. I also get why there might be legalistic reasons for not charging these officers with a crime, but there is simply no excuse for letting these animals remain on the NYPD.](104431457524.md)

 * [It is impossible to have a rigorous ethical justification for anything if you believe in a god.

 * [We have all heard the recent news of the Germanwings aeroplane that crashed into the French alps. A tragedy that cost 150 lives and seems more than just senseless. Something like this is incredibly hard to investigate and to draw valid conclusions from. And the French prosecutor Brice Robin has made it even harder. While it’s entirely possible that Andreas Lubitz did in fact willfully crash a plane full of people into a mountain, there are actually a number of alternative explanations (even without descending into conspiracy theories) for what happened. There has never been an actually fail-safe system. Things go wrong on a pretty regular basis. Alas, by talking to the press after only two days, claiming that the cause of this disaster was malice, the prosecutor is acting negligently. Unless there is significantly more evidence pointing to malice than the fact that Lubitz was heard breathing, this is a classic case of jumping to conclusions. No one is looking at whether the door actually was defective; no one is looking into whether it is actually possible that a confluence of other events could have lead to this outcome. And if there was actually some other cause, which led to an unconcious man hitting the right buttons and resting on them, we’ll never know. After all, at this point no one is actually looking into anything other than possible medical and psychological reasons for Andreas Lubitz to have intentionally crashed this plane. Not because these things are unknowable, but because no one will be looking. By making his statement so early on in the investigation, an investigation that most expected to take months or years, prosecutor Robin has preempted any actual investigation. This is incredibly negligent and should serve as a warning for the future. You never preempt an investigation into a problem; You never proclaim conclusions without solid evidence. And the fact that breathing could be heard is insufficient evidence. Unconscious people still breathe. So we are now left to hope, that Mr. Robin was actually right and this was a case of intentional malice; because if it was not, then there is a dangerous defect that could potentially cause more accidents and deaths.](114785591539.md)

 * [I have held a US license since 1994 and an Austrian license since 1996. Nevertheless the UK government in its infinite wisdom held it necessary that I actually get a British license, theory practical and all. But only after a year, because that long my license is considered valid in the UK. Ok, I thought, I can do that and went on to do them. No problem. What did get me though is that my car insurance company was aware of all of this. So when I informed them, as I was obliged to, that I had indeed confirmed fully with the law, they decided this would be a good opportunity to increase my car insurance by a factor of 3.5. After all, I had just gotten my license and could not drive worth shit having only 1 day of experience. Several freak-outs and polite invectives later that is now my former insurer. I then found myself a new company. It’s a bit more expensive than my previous one (+50% or a factor of 1.5) but still cheaper than the £&@€$# previous one. Which leaves me with just one question](124769025804.md)

 * [Morality based on a divine being is a circular argument. Ethics based on god is in fact not ethics. Morality based on god is not ethical but simply proscriptive. Claiming such proscriptive morality as objective, or worse absolute, is deliberately eliminating ethics from morality. Divinely based, proscriptive, morality is dangerous because it’s quite easily manipulated and not validatable since interrogating god on morals is not possible. Clarity and common understanding of terms for the purpose of this discussion is essential. As such the definitions used are all taken from Wikipedia, since these reflect the understanding of the terms of a large group of people. Morality is the differentiation of intentions, decisions, and actions between those that are distinguished as proper and those that are improper](134149862264.md)

And rightly so; Life is a lot easier if you pay with your wristband rather than making sure to carry enough printed paper or bits of tin around. There are however a few drawbacks. I encountered one of them today. I had left the office to walk over to the other building (my company is located in two nearby buildings in the city) when I was approached by this old bitty. I had seen her before, she spends her days trying to flog some newspaper or other to make a meager living. Mostly she looks destitute and cold. Well she approached me and asked me “Do you have any change for a hot drink?”. As I began to pad my pockets for the odd quid that might be left, I realized that the last time I handled cash money had been more than a week ago. I told that I had no cash-money on me at all, … “That what everyone says these days” was her resigned reply interrupting my sentence. … but there’s a Costa over there let’s get you a cup of tea. We ended up going to Eat instead. A hot bowl of soup still beats tea, even in Britain.

Eventually the topic got around to Donald Trump and his role as the Republican Nominee for President. The old farmer said, ” Well, as I see it, Donald Trump is like a ‘Post Tortoise’.“ Not being familiar with the term, the doctor asked him what a 'post tortoise’ was. The old farmer said, "When you’re driving down a country road and you come across a fence post with a tortoise balanced on top, that’s a post tortoise.” The old farmer saw the puzzled look on the doctor’s face so he continued to explain. “You know he didn’t get up there by himself, he doesn’t belong up there, he doesn’t know what to do while he’s up there, he’s elevated beyond his ability to function, and you just wonder what kind of dumb ass put him up there to begin with.”](157536690494.md)

 * [I’m not a fan of democracyNow that I have that inflammatory statement out of the way let me explain what I mean by it. Democracy is defined as the rule of the entirety by a majority of its constituents. If that majority is sufficiently large or the options are sufficiently close that may be acceptable. However if either the options are diametrically opposed or the majority is rather small (or worse both at the same time) this turns into oppression of the minority by the majority.As a matter of fact that was the reason why James Maddison advocated for a republic rather than a democracy in his Federalist Papers. He knew in the 18th century that in a pure democracy there was a real risk of the majority faction acting counter to the interests of a large minority or even the interest of the entirety.No system has demonstrated the truth of this better than the United Kingdom’s form of first past the post democracy combined with democratic referendums. And no historic event demonstrates this better than the referendum on leaving the European Union.In the Brexit referendum 52% of all votes cast voted to leave and 48% voted to remain. If one takes voter turnout into account that means that a majority faction of 37% voted for Brexit. While that result means there is (or at least was) a majority for Brexit, it also means that 37% of the population are now forcing their will on the 63% who did not vote for Brexit. On the other hand, just remaining is not a viable option either since that, by the same logic, would mean that 34% would force their will to remain on 66% of the people.The solution to this conundrum is not ignore expressions of voter preferences, but rather to stop worshipping at the altar of pure democracy and majority rule.As I said above, pure majority rule democracy of the flavour so popular in the UK leads to chaos and oppression whenever the options are diametrically opposed or the majority is small. In the case of Brexit both are the case.The solution is to accept that democracy is not the answer to running a country. Instead we should take our lead from the American founding fathers like James Madison. We should strive to establish a form of government that balances the wishes of the majority with those of the minority. Abolishing first past the post is a first step. Electing multiple MPs per constituency who are chosen by proportional voting would be an important step which would also counter gerrymandering. Requiring supermajorities for all referendums and many issues decided in parliament might be an additional safeguard.Whatever the UK decides to do going forward, we need to acknowledge that its form of democracy has failed to serve the entirety of its people and caused a painful division in the country that may take decades to heal.](182497697914.md)
 * [Open collaboration groups tend to strive for consensus in their decisions. Consensus as an ideal is a worthwhile goal because it allows for all participants to have a direct influence on the decisions and therefore fosters participation and values the participants. However seeking consensus can also lead to a lack of progress because individual voices have the ability to block all progress. When we created CAcert, a community CA, we realized that this was not a sustainable model. So we decided to borrow the concept of “rough consensus” from the IETF and adapt it to our needs.

 * [I’ve received the following from thd Scout Association.—Dear all,Many of you will have seen the media reports about the possible removal of the statue of Robert Baden-Powell, the Founder of the global Scout movement, from Poole Quay, in Dorset.The intention, we understand, is to avoid damage to the statue as the important debate continues around the role of historical figures, following Black Lives Matters protests across the world. This is a vital moment to have honest conversations, acknowledge the huge strength of feeling and renew our commitment to education and understanding with empathy and humility.As Scouts we stand together against racism, always. Inclusion and acceptance are at the heart of our values, and we are not afraid to call out racist language or behaviour.We strongly support the principles of Black Lives Matter and also stand with those affected by racism. We are a movement that inspires openness, kindness, understanding and the power of community and friendship.In the summer of 1907, a new movement was born on Brownsea Island, in Poole harbour Dorset – one that would bring skills, kindness and courage to millions around the world. It was here that Robert Baden-Powell founded the Scouts by taking a small group of young people from diverse backgrounds to live and work together. Their aim was to learn about the great outdoors, work in teams, and show we had more in common than divides us. Since that first camp, Scouting has grown, year on year, to become today a worldwide family, some 54 million strong, in almost every nation on earth. It is, without doubt, one of the greatest youth movements in history.But it’s right that we make time to listen, educate ourselves, and reflect on history - acknowledging where there are times when views and actions from the past do not match those values we live by today. It’s also right that we do not make any accusations or form any conclusions without the facts. These are the foundations of an open and honest debate about our society’s past and future.Baden-Powell was a complex figure, with changing and sometimes contradictory views that often reflected his time. We would never attempt to defend or agree with everything he did or said. However it’s obvious from the last 100 years, that Scouts has the power to unite people in a spirit of mutual friendship and respect and has become the greatest youth movement the world has ever seen.For generations, the Scout movement has brought millions of young people together from different cultures and backgrounds to promote friendship, cooperation and understanding. This happens at a community level across the UK, and at a global level at World Scout Jamborees and international camps. We are proud to build bridges between communities.As a movement, we’re also proud to support young people from every community in the UK, helping them develop values of integrity, respect, belief, care and cooperation.To actively support our members, we have created and shared guidance and resources to help parents and volunteers to have conversations about racism with young people. This is a first step in helping give our members the skills, confidence and courage to challenge racism and other behaviours that go against our values as Scouts.To be clear, there is no place for prejudice or discrimination of any kind in Scouts. Instead we actively celebrate the diversity of our members’ backgrounds, talents, thought and abilities that makes Scouting the vibrant community it is today.As Scouts, we must all continue to listen and reflect on how we live up to our values and strive to do better.Thank you for your own example, living and sharing our values.Tim KiddUK Chief CommissionerMatt HydeChief Executive](620666283405508608.md)
 * [At NodeConf.eu, there was a great talk by @adam_baldwin on node security and the Node-Security Project. After the talk while watching a bunch of nodecopters crash, I got to talking with Adam about security bugs in modules and the fact that he seems to me to be an incorrigible optimist thinking he can actually make things safe. You know the way people talk when they have a beer/cider in hand it it ain’t the first night out ;) Well Adam made a comment, that I should write a blog-post about it. I said that I’m not really into blogging. Well I’m not, but I try and try again. So this endeavour on tumblr is actually Adam’s fault. So here goes nothing. The Problem with Express/bodyParser was discussed heatedly up and down twitter. (If you missed it, be happy) I have a problem with the statements made in the article, because it misses the most important point. He writes a short piece of code, and then claims that it’s dangerous. And he is right however, I can do the very same thing with any API. while (42) setInterval(console.log.bind(console, 'Hallo'), 1) is pretty dangerous as well. (Go try it in your node-REPL and come back when you killed it ;) ) The point here is that any API, can be dangerous if you don’t know what you are doing. If you don’t think about what the module you want to use actually does, and don’t think about what you are doing, then well you are never going to write anything that is even remotely secure.

 * [The Atlantic published an Article titled The Hole in Our Collective Memory at the end of July. The article by Rebecca Rosen presents a study about the availability of copyrighted works from different decades. According to the article the study comes to the conclusion, that copyright law causes books that are still under copyright protection to be more likely to be out of print than those in the public domain. The conclusion from that is that copyright owners are not in fact monetizing the works they own, but rather let them fade into obscurity my not making them available. So while there is no profit from them being made, society is also loosing out on them because intellectual substance is locked away. Here is to hope that we can reverse at least some of the current state of IP-Stupidity by using studies like this. After all, this basically proves that the current copyright law achieves the opposite of what was intended when the original copyright laws were passed. Maybe we need to do the same thing for patents. After all, many have realised that the current patent regime harms innovation rather than fuelling it. If we could actually scientifically prove this realisation, maybe we have a chance of making some changes there as well.](62338974156.md)

The LA-Times reported that LAUSD halts home use of iPads for students, which might just be the silliest thing to it could do. The one thing sillier is to truly believe that it could prevent this to begin with. But aside from all that, there is a much deeper question that should be raised. That is not “can we prevent students from surfing the net”, but “should we prevent students from surfing the net”. As has been previously discussed in what inner city kids know about social media kids don’t really need to be protected from the internet by people that know less about it than they do. We (and the LAUSD) should be proud that students circumvented the stupid restrictions so quickly and commend them for it. They should also not restrict students use of the tools that they were given. The LAUSD should be embarrassed by all of this. Not that their security measures where circumvented, but rather that they thought they were warranted and their reaction to the circumvention. Maybe the people at the LAUSD should be sent back to school; obviously they are not yet ready for the 21st century.](62519637603.md)

 * [The US Congress, in particular the Republican faction of the House, has decided that their bruised ego is more important than pretty much anything else. So they decided that shutting down the entire US federal government (with a very few exceptions) was a good idea. One of the things that did shut down, was national parks. And that’s where my understanding really stops. Why shutdown a park. It has been around long before humans, it doesn’t really need running! Forcing people out and blocking the area off is just silly. First off, blocking the park actually costs money. Simply sending federal employees home would have been much cheaper. Second, what the heck are they “shutting down”? the gift store? - who cares! the trees? - how? why? the rocks? - how? why? the rivers? - how? why? the animals? - how? why? I don’t think any other country on the planet would even contemplate “shutting down a national park”. Maybe shuttering the ranger station and the gift shop for a couple of days, but this? It all started out as a couple of House Republicans showing of that they aren’t the brightest people in the world. It ended up demonstrating, that maybe those representatives are still a lot smarter than the park service.](62987347748.md)
 * [Dustin Kirkland wrote a very nice piece entitled Fingerprints are Usernames, not Passwords. He is pretty much correct about using biometrics as an authentication mechanism. It’s a bad idea in terms of security. What annoys me about the whole biometrics conversation though is that it pretty much misses the point completely. What is happening in the discussion is that on the one hand you have the biometrics industry, pushing biometrics as a solution for all kinds of security problems, and on the other hand security experts, and other smart people like Dustin, dispute that biometrics are inherently insecure. The core problem though is that security is a matter of definition. Let’s think about security in terms of the physical world. How do we secure our homes. We have locks, that can easily be picked; windows that shatter at the toss of a stone; doors that will not resist the boot of a determined intruder. And yet we are satisfied with the security provided by these measures. Thinking now in terms of IT systems, especially phones; Fingerprints are obviously insufficient security for the proverbial nuclear launch-codes. But then so are dinky locks insufficient for Fort-Knox. Are fingerprints sufficient for my smartphone though? Well that kind of depends on the information stored in there. For most of it, a fingerprint is enough. Just like a regular door and lock are sufficient for most parts of my house. But then there are small pieces of information, that may need to be on my phone secured by additional means, just like I have a safe at my house to better protect especially valuable items. You see, it really is a matter of degrees. For the most part, securing a phone, or laptop with a fingerprint is ok; it’s a sufficient deterrent to the casual intruder. And then there are pieces of data, that are a bit more sensitive. Those I’ll have to protect in addition to the regular access control. Passwords might be a good choice for a lot of that. However passwords aren’t all that great a solution either. They really are too weak for real security. If the proverbial nuclear launch-codes were protected with a simple password system, I’d be really scared. Nope, they are protected by multi-factor systems. For really sensitive data, that is a must. So security really is a matter of degrees; a matter of what needs to be secured and against what threats. And that’s why I’m so annoyed at the simplistic conversation going on about biometrics in security. To really provide us with good security, we will need to think about security much more in detail.](63002674000.md)

 * [After I read @maxogden’s tweet I was debating whether I really wanted to respond. Especially because this cartoon about these conversations (thanks @izs for tweet) does have some truth to it. However, I feel that there is a point that is being missed. We are all human beings first. If we create an environment where another human being feels unwelcome or uncomfortable, or worse threatened, that is a problem. For this to be a problem it does not matter one bit whether that person be female, male, cis-, trans- or whichever label you want to apply. It matters solely that a potential member of our community does not feel welcome. One consequence of having created such an environment is the sprouting of sub-groups reserved for the sub-members that carry some sub-label or other. And that in turn is the official certificate of community failure. So while having a girls night out with your node friends might be a valuable experience for a female noder (just as a stereotypical example), it should definitely not become a thing simply because it means that the node community has failed so badly that it has to be separated along more or less arbitrary gender lines. To me that’s not not about discrimination against men or any such non-sense. It’s about failing to provide a community where people are respected for who they are and what they bring to the table. So rather than advocating Non-Binary-Node groups we should be working diligently on making our community one that does not need those sub-groups. So if Max Ogden’s female friend is learning ruby rather than node because ruby has all these “women in ruby” groups, we should make the the effort of telling people, that they should learn node, because we have all those “humans in node” groups. Because that is truly being better rather than “no worse than usual”.](63971328006.md)
 * […and the market cannot compensate Mathew Ingram wrote a piece on GigaOM about a change in the google search algorithm to discourage mugshot sites and the often associated blackmail. He makes the case, not least with his title “first they came for the mugshot websites, but I said nothing” that this decision to actively discourage a set of sites is a slippery slope. The danger is that we will not know what will be hidden from us by google next. Google chooses what we see and don’t see He contrasts the fiction of “the right to be forgotten” that the EU is currently pushing, which would give the end user a choice in what will be remembered, versus Google deciding what will be forgotten by virtue of not being found. While I find the EU position to be an unrealistic fiction, I find this Google action to be a worrisome precedent. It is of course legitimate for Google, and that’s likely the argument they will put forth, to optimise for deducing the intent of the searcher and giving the best possible results. That is a specious argument though, because whether mugshot sites fit that intent depends on an assumption about intent that is decided on by google. Ultimately, it’s a decision that is made. The real issue is that the market cannot possibly have a chance to compensate. Usually, one would make the claim that since the filtering is beong done by a corporation and not a state entity, the market has a chance to correct any problems. This however assumes that consumers have an opportunity to notice. In the case of filtering the web consumers will never know precisely because they will not know what they are missing. Mathew’s worry about what Google will filter next is very valid. When it starts filtering things like Wiki-Leaks, or Snowden’s revelations, that would be a real problem. Especially since we will not know what we did not find and we won’t even know whether Google is filtering due to ideology or due to pressure from one or more states.](64214362742.md)

 * [Over the last few days I have done an experiment. The basic premise was that the way you hold your body directly impacts how people react to you. If that is true, then any change, conscious or not to your bearing should alter the reaction of the world at large towards you. Generally people walk slightly bent forward with the shoulders hunched slightly forward as well. All in all we generally appear more like the bicyclist in the the red shirt than the obviously proud participant in the NYC gay pride parade. What if, I were to change the way I walk. Quite consciously mimicking a soldier on the parade ground, or for that matter the specimen in the fore-front of the photo above. This should then result directly in an altered reaction of the world toward me. Now I did this experiment, and I do have some interesting results. The difference is actually more pronounced than I’d have ever thought. An upright posture automatically leads to a perceivable increase in perceived confidence. So simply by walking upright, people believe you are more confident. In addition, the altered reaction of your surroundings actually increases your own confidence. So you basically start a virtuous circle. Besides that I actually felt the strain in my back muscles for the first two days. After that it became much easier and my general posture improved a bit. I think I’ll keep going.](70312639439.md)

In 2012 I decided I wanted to loose some weight. Started to alter my lifestyle and am now living ultra-low-carb and lost 40kg. No resolution involved. In 2013 I decided to kick a 20 year 2 pack a day smoking habit. I have smoked my last cigarette on August 9th. Again no resolution involved. So you see, you can do things and accomplish things and never follow a new years resolution. On the other hand you can make resolutions for every new years of your life and never accomplish anything. So what’s my point? I am making a new years resolution, one that I’m actually likely to ignore just like all the others. I resolve to never again make a new years resolution.](71530927324.md)

What I am ponderous about right now, is some of the tumblrs I am following and their doubtful outlook on life. There are people doubting their self worth, people complaining about a shit year, and more negativity. And reality is, they are not perfect, and neither was the last year. But then I try to put things into perspective. We all have a roof over our heads, sufficient food and regular access to the internet. We live in more or less civilised and democratic countries that vouch-safe our personal safety. So actually for us, the year 2013 was comparatively awesome. But even if you don’t like the global comparison thing, there is something you need to realise. You exist, and you provide me with pleasure through your posts. And it is highly likely, that it’s not just me whose life you are improving. So even if the entire rest of your life were an abject failure, you would still be a valuable asset to this world. So rather than feel sorry for yourself, celebrate the passing of 2013 and get excited about the coming year. And do so in the knowledge that each and everyone of you is being appreciated. So thank you all for a fun year. Stay positive. No one I follow has a real reason to feel down about themselves.](71793998949.md)

True to my style they are random and jumbled. Take them as such and don’t inspect them for deeper meaning. I have been doing something or other with computers every since my mom gave up trying to understand them in 1983. Computers were more interresting than homework, so I spent my time on them rather than homework (totally worth it). Point is, I’ve been doing this for a while and have had the chance to observe quite a number of people in the field. I have seen genius and I have seen utter stupidity. And neither was tied in any meaningful way to gender. From my personal observations, I always thought that there is very little distinction in terms of gender and computers. But then i grew up on the tail end of a history of computing determined by women. Before my time even, computers were thought of as the domain of women. But I digress. Things have changed and today women in tech are, at least in the western world, a rarity. In recent years, we were off and on looking for people to add to our technical team. And it fell to me to find them. I did a lot of interviews, and the thing that actually surprised me was how many female applicants there were. From seeing how many women there are in tech, I would have expected around 10% when in actuality it’s closer to 50%. When you are actually looking to hire people, you are trying to figure out whether they are (or could be) any good at the job you want them for. For that you start by looking at the paper form. What is their experience like, how did they do in school, what did they write about for their thesis and so on. This is where I was in for surprise number two](71950567767.md)

Thing is, it’s not enough to simply divide the ingredients by 4. I mean what the heck is ¼ dash of salt? Also a lot of things like gratins go into the oven in a form. Yeah you can take a smaller form, but that also means less depth and less surface area. So for some things that can throw off your oven time by like 100%. For other things it doesn’t change timing, because it actually just needs time. So often on the first try I cook too much. But since most of the time I cook for myself only, since my family is decidedly not goin keto, I have to eat it myself. Problem there is that I am actually a pretty good cook, which means the stuff i make usually tastes amazing (at least to me), so not eating it all is really hard. Well any case, if you have any good low-carb (as in ultra low) recipes designed for one person, please write them up and submit them. I’m going to publish them and do a collection of them.

Actually it’s as simple as it is sad. No one cares about Eurovision. It has zero effect on anything, so it does not matter one bit who sings there. At the same time, the world is growing ever more accepting. There are people even asking for marriage equality, how dare they. Austria is using Conchita a fig leaf. Now they can refuse any real policy of acceptance, anything truly meaningful, and at the same time lay a claim to being a forward thinking place. So while I would love to live I a society that was truly accepting, Austria is not it. So how can we prevent this from becoming a phyrric victory?

 * [In 1933 the Nazionalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiter Partei gained power via an election. In 2006 Hamas gained power via an election. Both went on to quickly prove that they are utterly incompatible with humanity. To call either “legitimate authority” is sort of irrelevant in view of the damage wrought then and being inflicted today. Nations and states tried in the 1930s to appease and work with Nazi-Germany. Nations and states tried the entire 21st century to appease and work with Hamas-Palestine. The main difference is that Nazi-Germany had significantly more man- and firepower, so the scale of the damage wrought is on a quite different level; though the lesson remains the same](91977954019.md)

 * [Europe is emphatically antisemitic and has historically been so. Austria/Germany provided the world with visible and horrific proof of this in the 20th century, but one should not be tricked into believing that the rest of Europe, or America for that matter, is any less antisemitic. Had there been only slightly different circumstances antisemitism may well have overflowed elsewhere. The world was well aware of the murderous plans for Jews forged in Germany; after all Hitler used them as propaganda throughout his reign. Neither America nor the rest of Europe was entirely unsympathetic; to Germany that is. Jews, and anyone in sympathy with humanity in general, should be grateful to Japanese stupidity, and the fact that Germany happened to be in alliance with Japan, in attacking Pearl Harbor. Otherwise it may well be that Nazi-Germany would have succeeded in exterminating all Jews. After the war the international community was horrified at its own blithe inaction and blatant negligence. Like a child beginning to cry in view of the deliberately murdered goldfish on the carpet the victors of WWII decided to ease their consciences by creating the modern state of Israel. However one should not make the mistake of believing that Europe and the world at large had become any less antisemitic. Antisemitism simply became a subliminal principle rather than an openly celebrated attitude. Given this prevailing antisemitism it is almost incredible how inept the handling of world politics by Palestinians in particular, but Muslims in general, has been. After all, until the era of islamic terrorism, antisemitism had almost been sufficient to reduce Israel to a sliver of its current size and prowess. The muslim world has instead managed to alienate the rest of the world by continually denying Israel’s right to exist. Independent of the value of any claims pro or contra the legitimate existence of Israel, there is simply no way that any nation involved in WWII would every deny the right of Israel’s existence for it would be tantamount to acknowledging the at least passive complicity in the slaughter and extermination of millions of jews. At this point the existence of Israel is a historic fact whose legitimacy can, and should, no longer be challenged. So long as Palestinians do not unequivocally accept the right of Israel to exist and denounce any person or entity not doing the same there cannot be peace. Which brings up a thought that may close the circle](92167472989.md)

 * [I just dropped half our household at household (due to the move) at the local women’s shelter. * 1 box of DVDs * 1 box of Books * 1 box of Womens Clothing * 1 box of Childrens clothing * 2 boxes of Toys * 1 box of Food (Rice, Pasta, Beans, …) It made me feel acutely uncomfortable, because I felt the intense feeling of dislike rolling of these women mixed with fear and chuzpa and… I watched these three slight women wrestle with these heavy and huge boxes that I had trouble with when loading. They seemed like the ant carrying the apple in the cartoons, except without any of the grace of the ant. Suppressing my instinct to just pick up a box and carry it in I found it a challenge to accept that I was not welcome in their lair. Yet the fact that such places are needed is made abundantly clear by the radiating suspicion of these women. This is likely the only situation I have actually experienced where I could glimpse what any minority experiences full force](92721878599.md)

 * [After getting the Virgin Media stuff sorted, today is going to be painfully busy. First there is a whole lot of shopping to do … Bath Mats Bathroom Cabinets Laundry Hampers Printer Paper stuff I didn’t even know one could need … and after that it’s finally time to actually unpack our clothing and other stuff. So I guess we’ll be spending the afternoon deep in the wardrobes that we set up yesterday trying to restore order to our habitat. And then for the first time in over 10 years we will own a TV, which is supposed to be delivered today. And on Tuesday I’m expecting delivery of one of our new sofas. After that will be the first time one could reasonably claim that we have moved in. Yesterday we also met our neighbours to one side. They have only been living here since April, have 2 kids aged 13 & 16, and seem really nice. Except we won’t actually get together until they return from holidays in 10 days time. Oh and other important stuff we did already is getting home insurance, registering with a GP (doctor) and getting library cards for everyone. Interestingly, the library cards are what gives you access to all other facilities in the borough as well. So we’ll need them for the pool and stuff too. Well off to work, it’ll be a busy day!](94988630652.md)
