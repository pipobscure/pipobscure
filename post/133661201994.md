<p>Temperatures in the UK are going to fall sharply over the coming weeks because that is what happens at this time of year.</p>

<p>Meteorologists believe that winter, a spell of short, cold days commonly defined as a season, will be more or less exactly what you would expect.</p>

<p>Professor Henry Brubaker of the Institute for Studies said: “Household fuel costs will rise considerably as families try to increase the temperature of their homes.“</p>

<p>“People on the verge of death may die.“</p>

<p>“Ice and snow will create icy, snowy conditions.“</p>

<p>“Your car will refuse to start.“</p>

<p>“Because it’s winter.“</p>

<p>“It’s really nothing to freak out about, unless you’re a pre-Neanderthal cave dweller who believes sunsets are caused by Gark, the angry moon god.”</p>

<p>He added: “There’s a high probability that this winter will be followed by another sudden, weather-related phenomenon known as spring.”</p>

<p>Housewife Nikki Hollis said: “The important thing is to stay inside, carry a flaming torch at all times and don’t be sentimental about eating your plumpest child.”</p>
