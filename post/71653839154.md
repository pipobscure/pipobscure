A burger with chips &amp; a cream tea today.<br/>
If this discourages you then unfollow you, I’m not pandering to your every needs by being the perfect weight loss blog, I’ve lost 100lbs, I don’t have to answer to anyone.</p></blockquote>

<p>I so understand where you are coming from. I did the same thing around thanksgiving. Except the weeks afterwards my digestion was off and I totally felt like crap. So I swore to myself to give myself treats that actually make me feel good, not &ldquo;treats&rdquo; that I regret for weeks.</p>

<p>I hope for you you are more &ldquo;exception tolerant&rdquo; than I am and that you will actually not regret that burger and pizza.</p>

<p>As long as one feels good about onesself, everything is legit.</p>
