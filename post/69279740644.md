title: The Washington Post recently had an article entitled How the Internet is killing the world&rsquo;s languages in which the author expounded that a large set of languages are passing on. Throughout the article questions like &ldquo;how can this be averted&rdquo;, &ldquo;how can languages be save&rdquo; are asked like having more than 7000 languages is a good thing. Now I like language, and I love languages. Which is why I speak two like a native and another two to a level that I can hold an intelligent conversation. Thing is, that&rsquo;s just for fun and they are all major languages. Truth be told from the perspective of benefit to the world, I don&rsquo;t think more that a handful of languages are a good thing. Diversity is not a good thing in itself, nor is it a bad thing. It&rsquo;s just a thing. There is this claim that language diversity is a cause for cultural diversity. Again, so what. There are a lot of things that are expressions of culture. And we certainly don&rsquo;t want to keep all of them around. Guillotines were an expression of culture, so were witch-hunts. Do we really want to insist that all diversity and all culture is a good thing? Everything has its time and its time to end. Maybe it&rsquo;s just the right time to let 7387 languages slip into oblivion.

<p>The Washington Post recently had an article entitled How the Internet is killing the worldâ€™s languages in which the author expounded that a large set of languages are passing on. Throughout the article questions like &ldquo;how can this be averted&rdquo;, &ldquo;how can languages be save&rdquo; are asked like having more than 7000 languages is a good thing.</p>

Thing is, that&rsquo;s just for fun and they are all major languages. Truth be told from the perspective of benefit to the world, I don&rsquo;t think more that a handful of languages are a good thing. Diversity is not a good thing in itself, nor is it a bad thing. It&rsquo;s just a thing.</p>

And we certainly don&rsquo;t want to keep all of them around. Guillotines were an expression of culture, so were witch-hunts.
