And then he has to study a lot and learn as much as possible.</p>\n\n<p>I think this was the first time he understood what I was saying when I told him: &ldquo;We are moving to London, to make sure you have as many chances in your future as possible.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>It was good to see him excited about being here.</p>"
