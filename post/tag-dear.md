 * [Dear Tumblr users who I don’t know in real life, I really like seeing your personal posts, even the whiny angsty ones, and particularly the strange boring ones. I like these little windows into your lives even if I’ve never seen pictures of you and all I really know is that we like a few of the same tv shows. Please continue to let me read your to do lists and your conversations with strange relatives. Thank you, Stranger from the internet.](107543768389.md)
 * [I want to tell you a story; a joke really. A joke that has turned sour in our collective mouths. You see I’m from Austria. My grandfather told me this joke when I was younger and it stuck with me. It’s a joke that is quite dated as it stems from my grandfather’s youth in the 1920s and 1930s. Teacher](111164760229.md)

 * [If you decide to block the only thoroughfare at a train station and a kid falls over your luggage it’s a pretty dumb move to get in the kids face, especially if just behind the kid is it’s father that’s about double your size. When you the get told to chill by your girl friend as well as the father of said kid, it’s never smart to throw a punch at said father. If said father then decides not to engage in fisticuffs, but rather simply knees you in the balls and leaves it’s pretty silly to swear at your (ex?)girlfriend when she is leaving you there.

 * [Dear Jack, Thank you so much for your heartfelt, touching note. I’ve heard that you donated all your £153 pocket money savings to my Prizeo fundraiser on behalf of the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary. I cannot tell you how much that moved me. It pleases me no end to know that my novels, and the TV series based on them, have inspired readers as young as yourself to rally to the support of these majestic and too often stigmatized animals Alas, I cannot promise you a grisly death in THE WIND OF WINTER. Those spots have already been filled by some very generous donors, and there’s a limit to how many people even I can kill. However, inspired by your example, my friends at Prizeo and I would love to follow your lead with a $10,000 in your name to the UK Wolf Conservation Trust. That’s a wonderful organization that I’ve heard much about, and they are lucky to count people like you as supporters. I wish you the best of luck in your future career as a wolf conservationist, and hope that you inspire many others to follow your lead. Yours, GRRM](93003679463.md)
