How to fall asleep

***Monika:*** So how do you manage to fall asleep so fast? ***Marlene:*** Well I lie down and close my eyes and pretend to sleep. Then I just try until I sleep. ***Monika:*** And what if you don't? ***Marlene:*** Well then I just try some more. ***undefined*** --- ***undefined*** Monika is my wife and has trouble falling asleep. Marlene is my 7 year old daughter. Loving that she has already grasped the concept of "fake it 'til you make it"
