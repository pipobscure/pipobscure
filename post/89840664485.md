<p>What if colleges only made you pay the percentage of tuition that you failed, so if you got an average of 86 for the year you’d only have to pay 14% of the tuition, but if you got a 94 then it’d only be 6%. That way we’d be rewarding the success and even if you flunked the semester, you still wouldn’t have to pay for ALL of the tuition</p>

<p>You are the future. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s sort of like my <em>get the vote out</em> scheme: Set the income tax at 95% and give people that show up to vote a tax voucher that takes taxes down to where they are now. Same thing would happen to tuitions rather than costing and arm and a leg, they cost two arms and two legs. Well yeah, you only pay what you failed, but it&rsquo;s going to still be an arm and a leg.</p>
