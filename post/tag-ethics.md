 * [It is impossible to have a rigorous ethical justification for anything if you believe in a god. That is because the fact you believe in god will automatically be a shortcut to “because god said so”. In order to go the distance and have a valid ethical justification you need to completely rid yourself of any remnant of god.](107106832864.md)
 * [Morality based on a divine being is a circular argument. Ethics based on god is in fact not ethics. Morality based on god is not ethical but simply proscriptive. Claiming such proscriptive morality as objective, or worse absolute, is deliberately eliminating ethics from morality. Divinely based, proscriptive, morality is dangerous because it’s quite easily manipulated and not validatable since interrogating god on morals is not possible. Clarity and common understanding of terms for the purpose of this discussion is essential. As such the definitions used are all taken from Wikipedia, since these reflect the understanding of the terms of a large group of people. Morality is the differentiation of intentions, decisions, and actions between those that are distinguished as proper and those that are improper](134149862264.md)
