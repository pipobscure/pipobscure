butthatsanothershow: Why do...

<p>butthatsanothershow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why does “you get what you pay for” only apply to consumers and not employers?</p>

<p>Why do employers offering minimum wage expect dedicated, hard working, knowledgeable, experienced employees instead of just someone who shows up and does the job?</p>

<p>If you’re only willing to pay the minimum, you should only expect to get the minimum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guess what: It actually does work the same way!</p><p>Just as you are happy to buy that cheap disposable lighter for less that £1 that you throw away when the gas gets low, many employers are happy to throw away that cheap disposable worker when he/she/it stops working as expected.</p><p>Just like that disposable lighter performs its task well enough for you, that disposable worker performs her/his/its task good enough for the business.</p><p>The real question should be if there isn’t some inherent difference between objects and people that should cause a difference in treatment. But by drawing similes like:</p><p><b>Why does “you get what you pay for” only apply to consumers and not employers?</b></p><p>that difference gets obliterated.</p>
