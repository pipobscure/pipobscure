title: While functionally developed in the Netherlands, the most iconic boomboxes were created in Japan during the 1970s and &rsquo;80s. This was a time when Japanese design and manufacturing was evolving from a copying culture to an innovating culture, and the boombox is a great example of this. I want to find the inventors of these important &ldquo;grail&rdquo; boxes and tell the stories of how they designed the machines we love, before it&rsquo;s too late.

While functionally developed in the Netherlands, the most iconic boomboxes were created in Japan during the 1970s and ‚Äô80s. This was a time when Japanese design and manufacturing was evolving from a copying culture to an innovating culture, and the boombox is a great example of this. I want to find the inventors of these important ‚Äúgrail‚Äù boxes and tell the stories of how they designed the machines we love, before it‚Äôs too late.

            *Source: How Boomboxes Got So Badass | Collectors Weekly (via thisistheverge) &ldquo;machines we love&rdquo;? maybe I&rsquo;m becoming an old curmudgeon, but until people develop a taste for music (i.e. adopt mine üòâ ) I&rsquo;d rather they listen to their music with headphones. So Boom-Boxes are definitely not machines I love!*
