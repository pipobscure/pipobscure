The New Kodak Moment: Why Storytelling Is Harder Than Ever

            *Source: Every moment ever photographed was a Kodak moment. Until they f***ed it all up. A very interesting piece of how our perception of images has changed. Once the moments preserved by a photograph or video were special occasions. Through the ubiquity of cameras, the moments preserved have become much more mundane. At the same time the stories told by images have shifted as well, making visual story-telling harder. (via courtenaybird)*
