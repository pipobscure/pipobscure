First there is a whole lot of shopping to do …</p>\n\n<ul><li>Bath Mats</li>\n<li>Bathroom Cabinets</li>\n<li>Laundry Hampers</li>\n<li>Printer Paper</li>\n<li>stuff I didn&rsquo;t even know one  could need</li>\n</ul><p>… and after that it&rsquo;s finally time to actually unpack our clothing and other stuff. So I guess we&rsquo;ll be spending the afternoon deep in the wardrobes that we set up yesterday trying to restore order to our habitat.</p>\n\n<p>And then for the first time in over 10 years we will own a TV, which is supposed to be delivered today. And on Tuesday I&rsquo;m expecting delivery of one of our new sofas. After that will be the first time one could reasonably claim that we have moved in.</p>\n\n<p>Yesterday we also met our neighbours to one side. They have only been living here since April, have 2 kids aged 13 &amp; 16, and seem really nice. Except we won&rsquo;t actually get together until they return from holidays in 10 days time.</p>\n\n<p>Oh and other important stuff we did already is getting home insurance, registering with a GP (doctor) and getting library cards for everyone. Interestingly, the library cards are what gives you access to all other facilities in the borough as well. So we&rsquo;ll need them for the pool and stuff too.</p>\n\n<p>Well off to work, it&rsquo;ll be a busy day!</p>"
