lacigreen: what saying “not...

<p>lacigreen:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>what saying “not all men” actually does:</strong></p>
<ul><li>refuses to acknowledge that gender violence happens too often</li>
<li>takes the focus off the men who <em>are</em> violent and/or misogynistic</li>
<li>refuses to acknowledge that even good guys can enable the problem</li>
<li>makes the conversation about men and semantics instead of the epidemic levels of violence against women</li>
</ul><p><strong>what saying “not all men” does not do:</strong></p>
<ul><li>reveal a fascinating new insight that we didn’t know</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p><strong>what saying &ldquo;not all men&rdquo; should mean:</strong></p>

<p>Not all men agree that:</p>

<ul><li>rape</li>
  <li>coercion</li>
  <li>condescension</li>
  <li>inequality</li>
</ul><p>are perfectly alright. So if you think that all men think like you misogynist, chauvinist asshat, then <strong>you are wrong</strong></p>

<p>Until that is made so perfectly crystal clear, I will repurpose <em>not all men</em>, because that is the only valid use for that statement.</p>
