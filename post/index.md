So it seems as if school is working out alright. In other news: I have a sever toothache since Monday. Bad enough that I went to the dentist today. Any case, I have a major infection on one tooth that I had a root canal on about a year ago. It will need recrowning so we are talking a multi visit thing. For now I&rsquo;m on a course of antibiotics for the infection and pain relievers for the pain. On the 18th I&rsquo;ll get rid of the old crown and then we&rsquo;ll see. Yikes, it&rsquo;s going to be a painful month.](96557437567.md)

 * [*2014-08-27 14:04:03* The kids visited today. Jakob said: &ldquo;I want to work here some day. How do I do that?&rdquo; I told him learning English is a good first step. And then he has to study a lot and learn as much as possible. I think this was the first time he understood what I was saying when I told him: &ldquo;We are moving to London, to make sure you have as many chances in your future as possible.&rdquo; It was good to see him excited about being here.](95912758127.md)

 * [*2014-08-17 09:43:54* After getting the Virgin Media stuff sorted, today is going to be painfully busy. First there is a whole lot of shopping to do ‚Ä¶ Bath Mats Bathroom Cabinets Laundry Hampers Printer Paper stuff I didn&rsquo;t even know one could need ‚Ä¶ and after that it&rsquo;s finally time to actually unpack our clothing and other stuff. So I guess we&rsquo;ll be spending the afternoon deep in the wardrobes that we set up yesterday trying to restore order to our habitat. And then for the first time in over 10 years we will own a TV, which is supposed to be delivered today. And on Tuesday I&rsquo;m expecting delivery of one of our new sofas. After that will be the first time one could reasonably claim that we have moved in. Yesterday we also met our neighbours to one side. They have only been living here since April, have 2 kids aged 13 &amp; 16, and seem really nice. Except we won&rsquo;t actually get together until they return from holidays in 10 days time. Oh and other important stuff we did already is getting home insurance, registering with a GP (doctor) and getting library cards for everyone. Interestingly, the library cards are what gives you access to all other facilities in the borough as well. So we&rsquo;ll need them for the pool and stuff too. Well off to work, it&rsquo;ll be a busy day!](94988630652.md)
 * [*2014-08-16 17:37:00* Hitting another hitch in moving to London. I went to the Virgin Media shop last weekend to set up my broadband connection. They said: &ldquo;No problem, here is your modem, just plug it in and activate it. After that everything will work.&rdquo; Guess what, it actually worked just the way it was supposed to. At least until today. Today I get an email, that they want to do an installation appointment on the 26th sometime between 8am and 1pm. I called to cancel that, since there is simply no way I can take of a whole day from work just to get an installation done that is completely unnecessary. It&rsquo;s unnecessary because everything already works. The person on the phone was obviously employed by Virgin Media. But they obviously did not work for them, since they were being more than counter productive. They did cancel the installation, but they also canceled my account, so when I hung up my internet stopped working. Way to go Virgin Media. That&rsquo;s great customer service! So I called again. After spending ages on the phone, I actually got another representative, this one actually worked for Virgin Media, to agree that an installation appointment is not actually necessary. Except to reactivate my account, I would need to speak to the &ldquo;Quick Start Team&rdquo;. And they had already gone home for the day, so that now I have to call back tomorrow. I do have high hopes that I&rsquo;ll get everything sorted tomorrow, but the entire episode makes me very wary of their service philosophy. I know for a fact, that if I pulled such a stunt at my job (and I did do customer service all of last week as part of my training) I&rsquo;d not have to worry about remaining employed at my firm. How is it that a large organisation does not more effectively weed out such &ldquo;chaff&rdquo; from their midst?](94922852957.md)
