 * [You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.](63652238977.md)
 * [I’ve been fighting for now 14 years to try to do this, to make all the subway turnstiles make music. I want to make every station in New York have a different set of dominant keys, so that people when they grow up, later on in life, will hear a piece of music and be like, “Oh that’s Union Square.” So when you go through the turnstiles, there would be a thing that would make a beep of a certain note. And it would have a random note generator that would be based on a percentage, so that the root note would be a higher percentage of going off, then the third, then the fifth. And during rush hour in the bigger stations, it would hopefully make a really beautiful piece of music. Each line would be a piece. The green line would go through different chords and when they intersected with other lines that would change that station.](66974840984.md)
