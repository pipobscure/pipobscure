<blockquote><p><strong>2014 resolutions:</strong><br/>- smash the patriarchy<br/>- look fabulous while doing so<br/><br/></p></blockquote>

<p>You don&rsquo;t need to smash the patriarchy, because if your pater is any good at archy he will empower you to do anything you want to achieve and protect you against those trying to tell you what to do.</p><p>What you want to smash is the ASSarchy, and any one will look good doing that. So go, go, go for 2014</p>
