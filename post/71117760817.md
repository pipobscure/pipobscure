<p>trissarahtops:</p>

<blockquote><p>I got a tv I didn’t want or even remotely ask for a blue ray player I can’t use because I don’t own any DVDs or blue rays or have funds to buy any, slippers that are two small and a immersion blender ( something I already own). I know I sound like a spoiled brat but it bugs me every year that I can recall my brothers always bested me with gifts from the parents. Just give me cash already.</p></blockquote>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t there this christmas-gift-recycling-website?
I think it&rsquo;s called ebay</p>
