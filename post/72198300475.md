title: &hellip; problem is, most recipes are designed for four people. It&rsquo;s no problem to alter a recipe, once you have made it a few times, but until then. Thing is, it&rsquo;s not enough to simply divide the ingredients by 4. I mean what the heck is &frac14; dash of salt? Also a lot of things like gratins go into the oven in a form. Yeah you can take a smaller form, but that also means less depth and less surface area. So for some things that can throw off your oven time by like 100%. For other things it doesn&rsquo;t change timing, because it actually just needs time. So often on the first try I cook too much. But since most of the time I cook for myself only, since my family is decidedly not goin keto, I have to eat it myself. Problem there is that I am actually a pretty good cook, which means the stuff i make usually tastes amazing (at least to me), so not eating it all is really hard. Well any case, if you have any good low-carb (as in ultra low) recipes designed for one person, please write them up and submit them. I&rsquo;m going to publish them and do a collection of them. Thanks all!
