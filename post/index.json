		"title": "I&rsquo;ve received the following from thd Scout Association.&mdash;Dear all,Many of you will have seen the media reports about the possible removal of the statue of Robert Baden-Powell, the Founder of the global Scout movement, from Poole Quay, in Dorset.The intention, we understand, is to avoid damage to the statue as the important debate continues around the role of historical figures, following Black Lives Matters protests across the world. This is a vital moment to have honest conversations, acknowledge the huge strength of feeling and renew our commitment to education and understanding with empathy and humility.As Scouts we stand together against racism, always. Inclusion and acceptance are at the heart of our values, and we are not afraid to call out racist language or behaviour.We strongly support the principles of Black Lives Matter and also stand with those affected by racism. We are a movement that inspires openness, kindness, understanding and the power of community and friendship.In the summer of 1907, a new movement was born on Brownsea Island, in Poole harbour Dorset – one that would bring skills, kindness and courage to millions around the world. It was here that Robert Baden-Powell founded the Scouts by taking a small group of young people from diverse backgrounds to live and work together. Their aim was to learn about the great outdoors, work in teams, and show we had more in common than divides us. Since that first camp, Scouting has grown, year on year, to become today a worldwide family, some 54 million strong, in almost every nation on earth. It is, without doubt, one of the greatest youth movements in history.But it’s right that we make time to listen, educate ourselves, and reflect on history - acknowledging where there are times when views and actions from the past do not match those values we live by today. It’s also right that we do not make any accusations or form any conclusions without the facts. These are the foundations of an open and honest debate about our society’s past and future.Baden-Powell was a complex figure, with changing and sometimes contradictory views that often reflected his time. We would never attempt to defend or agree with everything he did or said. However it’s obvious from the last 100 years, that Scouts has the power to unite people in a spirit of mutual friendship and respect and has become the greatest youth movement the world has ever seen.For generations, the Scout movement has brought millions of young people together from different cultures and backgrounds to promote friendship, cooperation and understanding. This happens at a community level across the UK, and at a global level at World Scout Jamborees and international camps. We are proud to build bridges between communities.As a movement, we’re also proud to support young people from every community in the UK, helping them develop values of integrity, respect, belief, care and cooperation.To actively support our members, we have created and shared guidance and resources to help parents and volunteers to have conversations about racism with young people. This is a first step in helping give our members the skills, confidence and courage to challenge racism and other behaviours that go against our values as Scouts.To be clear, there is no place for prejudice or discrimination of any kind in Scouts. Instead we actively celebrate the diversity of our members’ backgrounds, talents, thought and abilities that makes Scouting the vibrant community it is today.As Scouts, we must all continue to listen and reflect on how we live up to our values and strive to do better.Thank you for your own example, living and sharing our values.Tim KiddUK Chief CommissionerMatt HydeChief Executive"

		"title": "There is no doubt in my mind that Brexit will be severely negative for Britain, both as a country and for the majority of its population. However recently I&rsquo;ve come to doubt that Brexit is an overall bad thing and am coming to toy with the thought that Brexit might be the best thing to happen and the harder the better. Let me explain why that is. To do that, I believe I have to explain a bit about me: I am a European and hold EU nationality. I am not a British citizen and have no vote in general elections in the UK. I do however live in London and hold down a good job that put&rsquo;s me - according to HMRC - in the top 5% by annual income and also provides additional private health insurance. I own my own home and several other assets, so neither my short-term nor long-term prosperity are in much doubt Brexit or no Brexit. I am also very socially liberal and quite metropoilitan so when the term &ldquo;liberal metropolitan elite&rdquo; is voiced I can only say &ldquo;that&rsquo;s me and I&rsquo;m proud of it&rdquo;. Beside that I am white and male and speak English to a level that most Brits or Americans can only aspire to and with an accent that most Brits would place in America or Canada, while most Americans would place in Britain. In short racism, xenophobia, misogyny or need are not problems I am facing or am ever likely to face. In short I live what must objectively called a very privileged life though not on the level of a Warren Buffet or even a Jacob Rees-Mogg. Politically I am probably most inline with - as a short-hand description - the Liberal Democrats, although I&rsquo;d be more on the left of that movement and can sympathise with many but not all of the ideas that Labour promotes. I believe we should have a strong health-care for everyone and excellent education across the board to the extent that Eton goes broke because the public education is of such quality that stingy Tories see it as a waste of money. I also believe that as a society we have an obligation to take care of our weakest members so that food-banks or homeless shelters should simply not exist. Given that position in life, I have a divided view on Brexit. On the one hand as an inhabitant of the United Kingdom I cannot want Brexit because it would or will be an absolute disaster for this ountry and this society. But it is something that Britons have chosen and gotten themselves into. As a liberal, who am I to proscribe the path this country chooses? On the other hand I am a European. There is little doubt in my mind that Brexit has significanlty assisted in stabilizing the European Union. Brexit has made it clear to all members that the EU is the only hope Europe has for a prosperous and relevant future. It has also caused the European Union to speak with one voice for the first time in a long while. In addition with Brexit the EU is excorporating one of the key blockers to a closer political union. Britain is certainly not alone in blocking further political union, but it is by far the strongest proponent; to the degree that the others such as Hungary are highly unlikely to be able to sway the EU as a whole in the future. This ever closer union, is both necessary for EU stability and for achieving the relevance on the global stage that Europe could have and wants to have. And if that closer union proceeds, I foresee the opportunity to have a strong core of the EU, which would exclude countries like Hungary, Norway, Poland and Switzerland. This core would form a federal entity. On the periphery there could form a collaborative free trade block that includes the current EU members that are not part of the core and makes room for countries like Turkey which are economically aligned but politcally too far away from European ideals. This outer group would also have room for a future Britain (whether with Scotland, Wales &amp; Northern Ireland or without). In short I can see Brexit as an opportunity for the European Union to progress and strengthen itself; and as a European this prospect is not unappealing albeit at the cost of the United Kingdom. At the same time while this scenario would be an incredible boon to the EU it would be disastrous for Britain. The income gap in this country would open up even further, many people would suffer and slide into destitution, the health-service would potentially collapse and people would die. All off this is already beginning to happen and Brexit achieved would only exacerbate the situation. I cannot in good conscience advocate for such an outcome. I don&rsquo;t however have a vote; and Britons seem hell-bent on self-imolation by electing a Tory government certain to take them down this path. So I am left to hope for a Labour majority (however unlikely this seems at the moment) and a Labour Brexit (with a customs union and single market membership) winning overwhelmingly in a second referendum. That way I might get a Brexit boon for the EU with at least limited damage to the UK; and the damage to the UK would at least be handled by a government that knows that compassion is a word."

		"title": "Open collaboration groups tend to strive for consensus in their decisions. Consensus as an ideal is a worthwhile goal because it allows for all participants to have a direct influence on the decisions and therefore fosters participation and values the participants. However seeking consensus can also lead to a lack of progress because individual voices have the ability to block all progress. When we created CAcert, a community CA, we realized that this was not a sustainable model. So we decided to borrow the concept of &ldquo;rough consensus&rdquo; from the IETF and adapt it to our needs. This has served CAcert well and has been the single best model for collaborative group management I have yet encountered. To quote the CAcert Wiki: Rough consensus is somewhere between a unanimous acceptance, and a clear super-majority. A simple majority vote of 51% is not sufficient, and a 100% vote is not required. In practice this means that all criticisms must be addressed sufficiently to be satisfied that all have had a fair say. But it also recognises that there will always be some who disagree. Perfect is the enemy of the good. This method allows for votes as an indication mechanism to determine the level of agreement that has been reached without the presumtion that a majority of any type will be sufficient to pass the decision. Even a single voice may suffice to indicate a lack of rough consensus. Which leads to the question of how a group can determine that rough consensus has been reached. The interesting answer is that this can be decided using rough consensus. The group can take indicative votes at any time both on the matter at hand itself or on whether rough consensus has been reached. Presuming honest dealing among participants, the vote indication on the matter could be significantly different from the vote indication whether rough consensus has been reached. As a practical matter if the answer to the question what would need to change about the proposal to reach unanimous consensus is: nothing any changes made would not increase the level of consent The first would be an indication that there are simply some whose objections are systemic rather than matter specific; this means there is rough consensus and the decision should be passed. The second case could be an indication that there are simply factual incompatibilities leading to two mutually exclusive choices that can never be reconciled. In this case an indicative vote can be taken whether rough consensus has been achieved or whether an entirely new approach needs to be discovered and proposed. In short this methodology allows for effective consensus driven decision making without the detrimental elements of requiring unanimity. While this model may not fit every possible situation, it served very well so far and can only be recommended as a general modus operandi."

		"title": "I’m not a fan of democracyNow that I have that inflammatory statement out of the way let me explain what I mean by it. Democracy is defined as the rule of the entirety by a majority of its constituents. If that majority is sufficiently large or the options are sufficiently close that may be acceptable. However if either the options are diametrically opposed or the majority is rather small (or worse both at the same time) this turns into oppression of the minority by the majority.As a matter of fact that was the reason why James Maddison advocated for a republic rather than a democracy in his Federalist Papers. He knew in the 18th century that in a pure democracy there was a real risk of the majority faction acting counter to the interests of a large minority or even the interest of the entirety.No system has demonstrated the truth of this better than the United Kingdom’s form of first past the post democracy combined with democratic referendums. And no historic event demonstrates this better than the referendum on leaving the European Union.In the Brexit referendum 52% of all votes cast voted to leave and 48% voted to remain. If one takes voter turnout into account that means that a majority faction of 37% voted for Brexit. While that result means there is (or at least was) a majority for Brexit, it also means that 37% of the population are now forcing their will on the 63% who did not vote for Brexit. On the other hand, just remaining is not a viable option either since that, by the same logic, would mean that 34% would force their will to remain on 66% of the people.The solution to this conundrum is not ignore expressions of voter preferences, but rather to stop worshipping at the altar of pure democracy and majority rule.As I said above, pure majority rule democracy of the flavour so popular in the UK leads to chaos and oppression whenever the options are diametrically opposed or the majority is small. In the case of Brexit both are the case.The solution is to accept that democracy is not the answer to running a country. Instead we should take our lead from the American founding fathers like James Madison. We should strive to establish a form of government that balances the wishes of the majority with those of the minority. Abolishing first past the post is a first step. Electing multiple MPs per constituency who are chosen by proportional voting would be an important step which would also counter gerrymandering. Requiring supermajorities for all referendums and many issues decided in parliament might be an additional safeguard.Whatever the UK decides to do going forward, we need to acknowledge that its form of democracy has failed to serve the entirety of its people and caused a painful division in the country that may take decades to heal."

		"title": "savedfromsalvation: When Was the First Christmas?by D.M. Murdock/Acharya SFor the past nearly 1,700 years, a significant portion of the Western world has celebrated the day of December 25th as the birth of the divine Son of God and Savior Jesus Christ. Thousands of images have been created, as well as songs, poems and other artistic endeavors, depicting the baby Jesus lying in a manger surrounded by ox and lamb, with the Virgin Mary, Joseph, angels and three Wise Men looking on in wonder at the luminous infant. This imagery, we are told, represents the very first Christmas, when the Lord of the Universe was born on this earth, on the 25th day of December in the year 1 AD/CE. But is this story true?“O, how wonderfully acted Providence that on that day on which that Sun was born…Christ should be born.”The tradition of “Christmas” or December 25th as the birth of Jesus Christ, the main figure of the New Testament who is believed by nearly two billion Christians worldwide to have been God in the flesh come to save mankind from its sins, is traceable to the late second to third century AD/CE. During that time, the Church father Cyprian (d. 258) remarked (De pasch. Comp., xix): “O, how wonderfully acted Providence that on that day on which that Sun was born…Christ should be born.” In other words, the Savior’s birth was being observed at the winter soltice. What is seldom known, however, is that prior to that time, Christ’s birth was placed on a variety of days, indicating its non-historicity:January 5th, January 6th, March 25th, March 28th, April 19th, April 20th, May 20th, August 21st, November 17th and November 19th.December 25th as Christ’s birthday makes its way into a “calendar” or chronology created in 354 AD/CE called the Calendar of Filocalus or Philocalian Calendar. In addition to listing the 25th of December as the Natalis Invicti, which means “Birth of the Unconquered (Sun),” the Calendar also names the day as that of natus Christus in Betleem Iudeae: “Birth of Christ in Bethlehem Judea.” Hence, we can see that people of the fourth century were clearly aware of the association, if not identification, of Christ with the sun, as they had been in Cyprian’s time and earlier, since Jesus is claimed to be the “Sun of Righteousness” in the Old Testament book of Malachi (4:2).“But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings.”Over the past few decades, many people have come to understand that “December 25th” represents not the birthday of a “historical” savior named Jesus Christ but the time of the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere, when the day begins to become longer than the night, and the sun is said to be “born again,” “renewed” or “resurrected.”Numerous Winter-Solstice Celebrations GloballyBy the time Jesus’s birth was placed at the winter solstice there had been numerous solstitial celebrations of the coming “new sun” in a wide variety of places. Many winter-solstice festivals can be found listed in my 2010 Astrotheology Calendar, for the month of December. As I write there:December is full of winter-solstice celebrations beginning in remotest antiquity. For example, the date of December 21st as the festival of the Japanese sun goddess Amaterasu represents her “coming out of the cave,” a typical solar myth.Likewise noteworthy is the festival of the Egyptian baby sun god Sokar occurring on 26 Khoiak, as related in the Calendar of Hathor at Dendera, corresponding at the turn of the common era to December 22nd. The longstanding ritual of Sokar being carried out of the temple on this day in an “ark” closely resembles the censored commentary by Church father Epiphanius (c. 310/320-403) concerning the Egyptians bringing forth the baby sun born of a virgin at the winter solstice.The winter-solstice celebrations were so important that at times they exceeded the one or two days of the actual solstice in the Gregorian calendar, i.e., December 21st or 22nd. Solstice celebrations therefore do not necessarily fall on the traditional time of the solstice but may occur up to several days before or after, such as is exemplified by the Roman celebration of Saturnalia, which began on December 17th and ended on the 23rd.Hence, a “winter solstice” birth as asserted for a number of gods would not necessarily be celebrated on those exact days or even on the more commonly accepted date of December 25th, which signifies the end of a three-day period of the solstice—meaning “sun stands still“—as perceived in ancient times. In this regard, the winter-solstice birthday of the Greek sun and wine god Dionysus was originally recognized in early January but was eventually placed on December 25th, as related by the ancient Latin writer Macrobius (4th cent. ad/ce). Regardless, the effect is the same: The winter sun god is born around this time, when the day begins to become longer than the night.In 275 ad/ce, December 25th was formalized by Emperor Aurelian as the birthday of Sol Invictus, the Invincible Sun, and it is claimed that Aurelian likewise combined the Greek festival of the sun god Helios, called the Helia, with Saturnalia as well to establish this solstice celebration. The highly important Mysteries of Osiris, which begin on the 14th of December and end with his resurrection on December 26th, follow a winter-solstice pattern similar to the Brumalia, Saturnalia and Christmas celebrations. The facts that this period comprises several festivities having to do with the passion, death and resurrection or rebirth of this prominent Egyptian sun god, and that the dates for these mysteries happened to correspond to the winter solstice when the wandering Egyptian Calendar was finally fixed, are extraordinary.How Far Back Do Winter-Solstice Celebrations Go?In my 2011 Astrotheology Calendar, the month of December is illustrated by the &ldquo;passage tomb” at Newgrange, Ireland, which is oriented to the sunrise on the winter solstice or around December 21st in the Gregorian calendar. This tomb—which has also been called a “temple” based on its evident importance—is guarded by a large boulder with spiral solar symbols and dates to around 3200 BCE. The winter-solstice sunrise at Newgrange sends a shaft of light down the cruciform corridor and chamber. This ceremony is believed to signify the “return to life” or resurrection from the death of winter. In this sacred site is thus a 5,000-year-old “cross of light” representing the resurrection to life or rebirth on “December 25th.”“In the sacred site at Newgrange is a 5,000-year-old ‘cross of light’ representing the resurrection to life and rebirth on ‘December 25th.’”There are many other archaeological sites globally that are astronomically aligned, particularly to the winter solstice, some even older than Newgrange, such as the wooden circle or “henge” at Goseck, Germany, which may be 7,000 years old. The building of such astronomically aligned edifices, which are widely understood to be “temples” of a sort, indicates that the ancient astrotheological motif of the sun god’s birth at the winter solstice is at least that old. Moreover, there is evidence that this solar observation is much older even than that.The suggestion that the winter-solstice celebration by human beings in several parts of the world, particularly in the farther northern reaches of the northern hemisphere, dates back to Paleolithic times and was part of religious “mysteries” even then is indicated by a number of artifacts, including the painting known as “Sorcerer with the Antelope’s Head” from Les Trois Freres caves in the French Pyrenees. As I write in Suns of God, these caves were occupied during the Magdalenian period, 10,000-16,000 years ago, although mythologist Robert Graves dates the paintings therein to “at least 20,000 B.C.”In Prehistoric Lunar Astronomy, Indian scholar S.B. Roy theorizes that these paintings are representative of secret deposits relating to the mysteries, remarking that they would “necessarily be performed at a particular auspicious moment,” upon which their potency would depend. This auspicious moment would be dependent on the solar and lunar phases, as well as the seasons.As I also relate in Suns of God, Roy further posits that the antelope-headed “sorcerer” was “a figure marking the onset of a season.” The reasons for this assertion include that the “remote traditions” in the Rig Veda and in Vedic astronomy relate that the Stag’s head represents the star L-Orionis and the winter solstice at the new moon, as well as the summer solstice at the full moon. Roy concludes that the sorcerer figure “marked the winter solstice,” which was “a great day in the Ice Age of Europe.” Based on the astronomy, the figure dates to 10,600 BCE.Discussing the European Magdalenian cave-dwellers of around 10,000 years ago, Roy also asserts:In Northern Europe and Asia, in latitudes of 60º and higher, where Slavonic languages now prevail, the winter was then long and dark. It was very cold. Everyone looked to the day of the winter solstice when the sun would turn North. The astronomers would know the date even though the sun itself was not visible. This was the great day, for the spring would now come.Thus, the winter solstice was an important factor in human culture, particularly that of the cold, northern latitudes, at least 12,000 years ago.“'Christmas’ is thus an extremely ancient celebration, predating the Christian era by many millennia.”The winter solstice celebration that developed throughout much of the inhabited world has been handed down as “Christmas,” i.e., December 25th, the birthday of the “sun of God.” “Christmas” is thus an extremely ancient celebration, predating the Christian era by many millennia.Have a Happy Solstice!"

If you’re only willing to pay the minimum, you should only expect to get the minimum. Guess what: It actually does work the same way!Just as you are happy to buy that cheap disposable lighter for less that £1 that you throw away when the gas gets low, many employers are happy to throw away that cheap disposable worker when he/she/it stops working as expected.Just like that disposable lighter performs its task well enough for you, that disposable worker performs her/his/its task good enough for the business.The real question should be if there isn’t some inherent difference between objects and people that should cause a difference in treatment. But by drawing similes like:Why does “you get what you pay for” only apply to consumers and not employers?that difference gets obliterated."

It just became second nature to close all the cupboards first thing in the morning (even though they’d been closed the night before). Which was when things escalated from banging cupboard doors to actually breaking things. Faucets, door handles, curtain rods ripped from the wall… all the repairs started to add up. “Look, I didn’t mind having an ethereal roommate, but I can’t afford to keep fixing all this shit. Here’s a pencil and some paper. Just write what’s bothering you–I doubt you could put anything that would be more expensive than having a plumber come out to replace all the faucets again.” The next morning there’s a scrawl line at the top of the page that devolved into an angry scribbling mess that tore through the page. Two cupboard doors were entirely ripped off. “I don’t want to get someone in to banish you, but this is ridiculous. Just tell me what you want.” The second piece of paper is ripped into shreds and several knives are embedded in the wall. A careful examination of the paper scraps show that it had the same scribbles as the first piece. A quick trip to the library and a stop at a store later, there are kindergarten workbooks on learning to write spread across the counter. “Look, I don’t know if you’re just being difficult, but I hope not. So I got an audiobook on learning to read and write, and here are some workbooks for kids–don’t get mad–to teach them their letters. Just press play on the stereo, and work through the books at your own pace. I’ll get more when you finish.” The first workbook is half-completed before being ripped to pieces, but at least there was no other damage. Replacing it is significantly cheaper than replacing cupboard doors. It takes awhile, but eventually the workbooks progress to a fifth grade level. These ones are starting to be more costly (they’re bigger, for one thing), but it’s not even the money anymore. Little notes scrawled in a shaky hand appear on the steamy bathroom mirror Have A gooD dy Or written in ketchup on the counter (that was a frightening sight the first time) You R out of MLK And then one day there’s a message taped to the fridge. The spelling and penmanship isn’t the best, but it’s legible and even signed. Dear Occupente, I have haunted this spot for ovr three huner hudre 300 years. My bones are dust and I am fergotN.

		"title": "Those in favor of these programs have trotted out the same rhetorical question we hear every time privacy advocates oppose ID checks, video cameras, massive databases, data mining, and other wholesale surveillance measures: “If you aren’t doing anything wrong, what do you have to hide?” Some clever answers: “If I’m not doing anything wrong, then you have no cause to watch me.” “Because the government gets to define what’s wrong, and they keep changing the definition.” “Because you might do something wrong with my information.” My problem with quips like these – as right as they are – is that they accept the premise that privacy is about hiding a wrong. It’s not. Privacy is an inherent human right, and a requirement for maintaining the human condition with dignity and respect. Two proverbs say it best: Quis custodiet custodes ipsos? (“Who watches the watchers?”) and “Absolute power corrupts absolutely.” Cardinal Richelieu understood the value of surveillance when he famously said, “If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man, I would find something in them to have him hanged.” Watch someone long enough, and you’ll find something to arrest – or just blackmail – with. Privacy is important because without it, surveillance information will be abused: to peep, to sell to marketers and to spy on political enemies – whoever they happen to be at the time. Privacy protects us from abuses by those in power, even if we’re doing nothing wrong at the time of surveillance. We do nothing wrong when we make love or go to the bathroom. We are not deliberately hiding anything when we seek out private places for reflection or conversation. We keep private journals, sing in the privacy of the shower, and write letters to secret lovers and then burn them. Privacy is a basic human need."

Like, what if his name just happens to be Montgomery Scott, so all of his friends started calling him “Scotty,” and then every time he was introduced to a new person, they would be like “Oh, are you Scottish? My uncle was Scottish!” And finally, he just gets sick of explaining the situation, so he starts replying with “aye, laddie!” But then it turns out that the person he said that to was Captain Kirk, and he doesn’t want to admit that he lied to his new commanding officer, so he has to keep speaking in a ridiculously over-the-top brogue and commenting constantly on how much he loves drinking Scotch, and by the time that he realises that Kirk would have found humour in the situation, he’s in too deep and can’t stop pretending, and it gradually just becomes his normal speech pattern. Then, years later, the Enterprise is being inspected by a Starfleet engineer who’s actually Scottish, and Scotty takes him on a walking tour of his warp engines and is all like “Auch! Here be me wee bairns!” and the other engineer is just like “what the fuck is wrong with you?” I take the fact that James Doohan is Canadian as evidence of this theory. Scotty hacking into his Starfleet personnel file to alter his place of birth. Scotty soundproofing his quarters on the Enterprise so that no one can hear him teach himself to play the bagpipes from instructional videos. Scotty making a great show of taking a shuttle down to Aberdeen to “visit his family” every time the Enterprise is in Earth orbit and then, once on the ground, discreetly site-to-site transporting himself to Vancouver or whatever. None of these things are out of character or beyond his technical ability. Yeah, but also in character: Jim Kirk has known since Day 1 that Scotty is not, in fact, Scottish, but is just sitting there waiting to see how far Scotty is willing to go to keep the story going. It started out as an “enough rope” situation but now it’s one of Jim’s greatest ongoing sources of entertainment and he wouldn’t admit at gunpoint that he knows. "

On the other hand a set of absolute geniuses could raise the average enough for more than 50% to be below average intelligence.

It’ll be 3.5 pages long. they’re in Great Britainwhere in the world is an 11-year-old black girl going to get a gun the store Britain isn’t America. You can’t just walk into a random supermarket and buy a ton of guns. In fact, a gun is several hundred pounds each due to you needing to have a separate license for each one. Then you also need to have it where no one could accidentally find it and if anyone apart from you knows where the gun is, you lose your license and gun. I think it has to be locked up in a position no one will ever find it in. Pretty much, an eleven year old kid is not gonna get a gun in Britain. she goes to a wizard school with a three headed dog in the broom closet. i feel like some ppl r havin trouble understandin the concept so i illustrated it (my headcanon is that she is promoted to new dumbledore and she is twice as gayer than the last one) It get&rsquo;s even worse. This is in Britain; the preferred weapon when kids play cops &amp; robbers is a bloody whistle! They don&rsquo;t even think about a gun unless they are playing America. So this kid goes to a wizarding school; one would think this kid wouldn&rsquo;t even want to get a gun. Instead that kid would opt for some truly terrifying magical weapon. So sorry, but this head-cannon cannot work. 😀"

I’m married to a fairly fucking aware feminist-identified man and he still can’t take care of himself for shit and it is the one major source of tension in our marriage and it has led to so much tension now that I’m in med school that I have repeatedly seriously contemplated divorce. It’s not a small issue, it’s not trivial. You are a PERSON, not an endlessly nurturing selfless machine. You deserve to have your own story, not be picking up socks in someone else’s. And to all the &ldquo;men&rdquo; out there: if you can&rsquo;t iron her a blouse for that job-interview or cook some soul-food for when she&rsquo;s had a tough day, then you simply don&rsquo;t deserve her."

(if that makes any sense.) so the artists did weird things. new things! putting things that were already made together and calling it sculpture, cutting up bits of pictures and putting them together and calling that something to frame - this site has some nice examples. but from my perspective - there’s serious intellectual continuity between the absurdity of attaching a bunch of tacks to the bottom of an iron, rendering it useless, and say…. bath bomb posts. Put a fucking macbook in a bath. it’s useless now. Nobody fucking cares anymore. you want something funny? you want a punchline? gun. that’s your punchline. Take it. I am laughing in a way it could be a method of venting some of the frustration and hopelessness and dissatisfaction that tumblr’s userbase (largely, disenfranchised millennials) feels in the modern day. I can’t really speak for anyone else, but… at least from a US perspective, there’s plenty to be disillusioned about. growing up in a constant state of questionably justified war, income inequality, an economic recession caused by the actions of a handful of wealthy fucks who didn’t even get properly punished, growing awareness of police brutality, being called lazy and self-absorbed by the generations that gave us these problems in the first place… I can’t help but think that these factors (and more) could produce a similar mindset to the one that precipitated the first dada movement. so of COURSE we make nonsense jokes. it’s a coping mechanism for a world which doesn’t make any sense. related: this isn’t by tumblr but I have to plug UCLA’s atrocity of a virtual gallery once more. it really needs to be experienced, but… it’s definitely also millennial neo dada. from the presentation (like an unplayable video game) to the content (THE DOGS HAVE ARRIVED), it is exactly what I am talking about. it is a fucking shitpost. and it’s high art, too! I love this tl;dr: my generation is fed up with this bullshit, and the best way that we can express that is by shitposting. alternatively, dada was an early precursor to modern shitposting and we should all thank duchamp for signing a fucking urinal a dear friend has given a perfect update to some of my phrasing, courtesy of their word replace extension: you see this? this is exactly what I’m fucking talking about. the thing that I’m talking about is: I’d also say that while Dadaism was obsessed with the technological aspects of Modernity, of newspapers, of industrial mechanics and factory made clocks, neo-dadaism (of which shitposting but also the increasingly broad reach of the New Aesthetic and net aesthetics) is obsessed with the technological aspects of our time, or at the beginning of our time. As just a comparison, the Clock in Absurdist and Dadaist art is both a symbol of the uplifting beginning of industrial relations (as one of the first complicated machines made by manufacturers, as the symbol of mankind’s ability to triumph and analyze nature and better ourselves) and as the deified symbol of horrific modernity (of demarcated time, labor hours, the oppression of the working class via managerial time), Neo-Dadaism/Absurdism has a similar relationship with early computers, which both symbolizes the utopian attitudes which we entered the digital age with, and the horrifying period we live in now, where the Digital is ever present and semi-deified. My favorite dada satire is probably from Georges Grosz who takes the kind of robotic modernist tube people of folks like Leger: and turns them into these mindlessly patriotic broken automatons chanting rote phrases: And it’s so so funny to me that there’s all kinds of Gen X artists out there creating art about the millennials on their damn cellumar phones who think they’re the inheritors of this aesthetic but really it’s people who use the Madden gif generator to shitpost because they’re taking the technology meant for a coherent purpose for a particular narrative and they’re breaking it and turning it back on itself. I think you might be onto something… x Aside from color palettes and materials used, I see literally zero difference. This is one of the top 3 best posts I’ve ever seen on tumblr and I’ve been here for years. Love STATUS: DAY MADE. o This post has been on my mind constantly for ages. This just keeps getting better.

		"title": "Can someone explain to me why the media portray U.S. politics is like a bloody high-school drama? I mean there is Hillary being portrayed as this mean lying bitch that is still so in love with her beau Billy that she keeps writing “Mrs. President” in her notebooks with hearts over the i. Except that she’s not actually that big a liar or mean or a bitch. In reality she has spent her entire life working to make things just bit better. And finally she realised: well there is this top job and I can actually do it. Then you have Donald, your classic jock bully that goes around insulting and pushing around everyone. But no-one minds because he’s like the captain of the football team and what not. In reality Donald is in fact an obnoxious bully that has never grown out of being a pubescent asshat. He’s getting away with it because we all prefer the soap-opera like teen drama to actually mature people concerned with the world. This would be funny if this wasn&rsquo;t going to impact everyones bloody lives. And with everyone I mean every single person on the planet. This thing should be no contest! If the electorate were even half way sane this should be a landslide loss for Trump the likes of which haven’t been seen. Instead we have seemingly intelligent people make statements like: “I can’t vote for Hillary because she’s such a liar” “I’ll vote Trump because he has a plan” “You shouldn’t take Trump literally, you need to take him seriously” Come on, get your head out of your arse. At this point it should have become abundantly clear that if you are a human being that has any values at all, Hillary Clinton is the only candidate to vote for. If you can’t get over your ingrained misogyny even when presented with an alternative that is so blatantly against everything we as humans have accomplished over the last 200 years, you need to have a good look in the mirror and tell it to your own face: “I am a deplorable asshole”"

What you are being taught here is an amalgam of current prejudice and the choices of this particular culture. The slightest look at history will show how impermanent these must be. You are being taught by people who have been able to accommodate themselves to a regime of thought laid down by their predecessors. It is a self-perpetuating system. Those of you who are more robust and individual than others will be encouraged to leave and find ways of educating yourself — educating your own judgements. Those that stay must remember, always, and all the time, that they are being moulded and patterned to fit into the narrow and particular needs of this particular society."

(Though there are some people who are afraid that four years later, that’s where we might be, and I don’t blame them.) Do you remember that article about England’s new disability laws that suddenly declared a large chunk of people capable of work based on absolutely no medical recommendation at all? And how six months later the suicide rates had spiked within that community? That’s what we mean. Slowly, all of the things society has put into place to help people will dry up. Disability allowances, at risk teen hotlines and programs, pre natal care for the poor, all of those things that quite frankly barely make a drop in the budget but still manage to save lives will start to dry up. Right around the time an inevitable rise in violent hate crimes and non violent denials of human rights (worse than it is now) and slowly, ever so slowly, you will stop being able to talk about things. And we will die. Either through neglect or our own hands. But we WILL die. And you won’t know it because no one will talk about it. One day you’ll look up and there will be another hole where an entire generation has been ripped away from life for no other reason than being who they were. "

And rightly so; Life is a lot easier if you pay with your wristband rather than making sure to carry enough printed paper or bits of tin around. There are however a few drawbacks. I encountered one of them today. I had left the office to walk over to the other building (my company is located in two nearby buildings in the city) when I was approached by this old bitty. I had seen her before, she spends her days trying to flog some newspaper or other to make a meager living. Mostly she looks destitute and cold. Well she approached me and asked me &ldquo;Do you have any change for a hot drink?&rdquo;. As I began to pad my pockets for the odd quid that might be left, I realized that the last time I handled cash money had been more than a week ago. I told that I had no cash-money on me at all, &hellip; &ldquo;That what everyone says these days&rdquo; was her resigned reply interrupting my sentence. &hellip; but there&rsquo;s a Costa over there let&rsquo;s get you a cup of tea. We ended up going to Eat instead. A hot bowl of soup still beats tea, even in Britain. While living in a cash-free world might be convenient, let&rsquo;s not forget that there is one big advantage to cash that has yet to be figured out: you can give it to someone. We went into Eat and got that cup of soup and a sandwich for later. I got the pleasure of making sure this old bitty got warmed up and was having lunch this day. As a cash-less society though, we need to make sure that that second half of the sentence is getting said."

		"title": "Morality based on a divine being is a circular argument. Ethics based on god is in fact not ethics. Morality based on god is not ethical but simply proscriptive. Claiming such proscriptive morality as objective, or worse absolute, is deliberately eliminating ethics from morality. Divinely based, proscriptive, morality is dangerous because it&rsquo;s quite easily manipulated and not validatable since interrogating god on morals is not possible. Clarity and common understanding of terms for the purpose of this discussion is essential. As such the definitions used are all taken from Wikipedia, since these reflect the understanding of the terms of a large group of people. Morality is the differentiation of intentions, decisions, and actions between those that are distinguished as proper and those that are improper: In other words, it is the disjunction between right and wrong. Ethics is the branch of philosophy that involves systematising, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct. Moral objectivism is the meta-ethical position that some system of ethics, or a universal ethic, applies universally. Moral absolutism is an ethical view that particular actions are intrinsically right or wrong. In short the difference between morality and ethics is that morality is the the decision of what is right and wrong while ethics is the route to arrive at that decision. Ethics does not just ask the question &ldquo;Is this right or wrong?&rdquo; but, just like maths in school also asks &ldquo;show your work&rdquo;. When making god the ultimate arbiter of morality the purpose of ethics is eliminated. Ethics becomes trivial since the answer to these questions will always be &ldquo;It&rsquo;s right if god says so and because god says so&rdquo;. While this might be appealing, because it&rsquo;s easy, it&rsquo;s also not really ethics. &ldquo;Because&rdquo; is not a valid ethical examination or answer. Not just is it not a valid answer, it reduces morals to a list of proscriptions curated by the deity in question. In effect, when claiming a deity as the ultimate arbiter of right and wrong, two things happen. First the morals proscribed by that deity become absolute morals and second the establishment of morals is externalised or delegated. This might not be a problem if there was an actual present communicative god who speaks in clear language rather than &ldquo;working in mysterious ways&rdquo;. However even if one were to believe in the existence of a personal god, it is not one that directly and clearly communicates its will in the present for all to hear. Instead the deities dictums are interpreted and proclaimed by a group of people with impressive appellations such as &ldquo;Priest&rdquo;, &ldquo;Reverend&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bishop&rdquo;, &ldquo;Rabbi&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mullah&rdquo; or &ldquo;Imam&rdquo;. So rather than the deity curating the moral code it turns out that human clerics take on that charge. Delegating the process of arriving at morals to clerics is convenient for several reasons. Firstly it eliminates the need to actually go through the process of ethical deliberation. Second it abdicates not just the work of ethics it also delegates the responsibility for the conclusions reached. Thirdly in a static world with few novel situations it reduces the overall energy expended on reevaluating valid conclusions. This works quite well while society is static. When few if any situations come up that have no moral precedent in living memory delegating the process of ethics is quite sufficient. However when society changes because of more global interactions with people that have come to different moral conclusions, this breaks down. In such a situation every individual needs to be able to actually go through the ethical process and derive moral values. One charge that has always been brought against people that have no use for a deity is that they are unable to arrive at universal or absolute morals. After all, that is what god is supposedly providing in the moral arena. A point, incidentally, that has been thoroughly disproven by Sam Harris in his book The Moral Landscape in which he&rsquo;s laying out a method of ethics that allows for arriving at universal morals without the need for a deity. When instead ethics has been eliminated and delegated to a deity the required practice in ethics isn&rsquo;t there. As a recent example of absolute deity based morals a father strangulated his 19 year old daughter for premarital sex. He claims his morals are derived from his god, his religion. If we delegate the ethical process to god then there is little that can be said to counter such an atrocity. It ends up in a &ldquo;battle of the gods&rdquo; or &ldquo;whose interpretation of gods will is better&rdquo;. In fact deity based morals end up being very much relativistic and atrocious. If we want to have a solid moral foundation and ask everyone to accept it as universal, we need to actually practice ethics; we need to actually go through the process, both personally and as a society, continuously an repeatedly; we need to reason out why something is right or wrong and accept that &ldquo;because it&rsquo;s in the bible&rdquo; or &ldquo;because god said so&rdquo; are not valid answers. We as moral human beings have to come to the conclusion, in light of our experience, that morals based on a deity are not just insufficient for our current world but lead us down a dangerous relativistic path that leaves us unable to actually arrive at well founded morals for novel situations. We have to conclude that god based morals are not just insufficient but positively unethical. To lead us into absurdity I want to close with the bible which also supports humans being capable of knowing good and evil on their own. For God knows that when you eat of it [the tree of knowledge] your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil. So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate.&ldquo; Genesis 3:5-6 After all we got thrown out of paradise for it :)"

I am one scary looking dude, so the entire time she&rsquo;ll feel the threat of me looming behind her and followinf her. If on the other hand, I hold the door so that she can follow me through, I&rsquo;m still being nice. However now I&rsquo;m walking in front of her going my way. Since she is the one following (or not), I am no longer perceived as a potential threat. So ladies, when a man smiles and walks out in front of you, he&rsquo;s not trying to be uncourteous. On the contrary, he may just be making an effort to make you feel at ease and safe. So guys, think about how you come across. You might think you are being courteous. In reality you are maximising the perceived threat."

		"title": "mrsbeetonsdog: Don’t do it! You narcissistic (look it up), superficial, empty-headed pipsqueak (and again). Spend the money instead on a book or, even better, a present for your mum. You are not a “gangsta”, living a “thug life” in “da hood”. You haven’t read any scriptures, shakespeare or ancient texts, nor been anywhere or done anything in your life, which would warrant such an act. You are not from some Pacific Island tribe. It is unlikely you are a Maori. Those symbols have deep, historical, spiritual and cultural meanings, going back thousands of years. You, on the other hand, are probably called John, or Steve, or Julie or Cheryl, have nice parents and own a smart phone you got as a Birthday present. If you have a job, you probably work in an office. Or “food services”. Grow the fuck up. Tattoos do not make you appear spiritual, deep, interesting, intelligent, individualistic, nor a rebel. (At least not to anyone who is authentically any of those things). Perhaps it will to your friends, but I mean, look at them…. Still commited to getting a tattoo? Of course you are. Well, if you insist on pursuing your vacuous ambition like the rest of the vanilla-flavoured masses you so desperately wish to ape, (sorry, differentiate yourself from), then here goes; 1. Let’s start with the basics. Remember school? No, of course you don’t. A is for…….? Apostrophe. At school you were taught that; You’re = you are. We’re = we are, They’re = “they are”, It’s = “it is” and Won’t = “will not”. Can’t is the contraction of “cannot”. Got that now? No? Okay, let’s move on anyway and long live the English GCSE! 2. The correct spelling of the words you will, depressingly, be looking to use, are as follows; beautiful, tragedy, heart, spirit, remember, believe, strength, stronger, spirit, breathe, judge, angel, guard(ian), achieve, freedom, honour, valour, tomorrow, wisdom…….. Look, basically, buy a fucking dictionary! 3. Do not get a tattoo quoting something you have not read, let alone understand. E.g. Corinthians in the Bible, Hamlet, Reinhold Niebuhr (exactly!), Nietzsche, the Bhagavad Gita….nor, indeed, anything else which is not in English. (If you need a dictionary to spell the word tragedy, what fucking chance do you think you’ve got with Mandarin or Sanskrit?) 4. Make sure neither you nor your tattooist are in any way physically or mentally impaired. If you are one and the same person, put the tattoo machine down, step away and go and play with something more appropriate (like a crayon and a circle of coloured paper) 5. Spell-check it, or, failing that…. 6. No, seriously, SPELL-CHECK IT, I’m not kidding. Or, if you don’t have time for that…. 7. ARE YOU FUCKING LISTENING TO ME, MORON?! I SAID, FUCKING SPELL-CHECK IT!! JESUS CHRIST!! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU??!! 8. Please see 5-7, above. Thank you. 9. If you really can’t be arsed to do any of the above, then just get a bunch of flowers done or some similar bollocks. Maybe a little heart with a smiley face on it? Or your name? Hmm? 10. If you’ve read this far, congratulations! Your attention span is at least equivalent to that of the average six year-old South Korean schoolchild. Hopefully, you will also possess their common sense and, therefore, be in no danger of getting a tattoo. Now go out and buy your mum a present with the money you were planning to spend on drink or some smart phone app shit, you smug, self-centred, ungrateful, little fucker, you. © MrsBeeton’sDog.

People like me don’t worry about what it’s all about in a cosmic sense, because we know it isn’t about anything. It’s what we make of this transitory existence that matters. These kinds of questions always make me think of Richard Feynman on beauty, science, and belief. "

I have a sticker that I can put on my till and a pin that I put on my uniform that says DEAF so that people know. The packer who was packing up her groceries told her I was Deaf and her response to him was ‘She should learn to listen better if she is going to work in the service industry.’ My packer then tried to continue to explain to which the lady told him that it was still my responsibility to have a conversation with her if she wanted one and that instead of watching the screen to see if her groceries scanned through I should listen to the beeps that way I can talk to her. 3 times my packer explained to her that I physically am unable to hear and no matter what I won’t be able to pay attention to both what she is trying to tell me and to the computer to make sure all the groceries went through. And still she complained. And now because she complained to both the store managers and the front end manager they might have to put me on suspension for 3 days because of it. What fucking bullshit audist society do we live in????? Hell fucking no. A lawsuit waiting to happen. Take em out, dear.You don’t deserve that bullshit. Have them tell her that she is in fact not entitled to a conversation from you or anyone else. If she wants someone to listen to her babbling there is a professional she can go to. They are called talk therapists. And they can also help her with that personality issue at the same time."

The next day, Gray met James Zieske, the institute’s senior scientist, who told her “infant eyes are worth their weight in gold,” because, being so young, they have great regenerative properties. Thomas’ corneas were used in a study that could one day help cure corneal blindness. Thirteen more studies had cited that study. Gray felt a new emotion: pride."

Even when it’s a legitimate case of racism or sexism. It’s like we have this story you tell children in Poland (I wonder if other countries have similar ones. Followers?). It’s about a chicken who kept alerting other farm animals that a fox is trying to eat it. The animals rushed to the rescue just to be laughed at by the chicken who fooled them. And when one day a fox was really trying to get him and he screamed for help, no one came and the chicken got eaten. Brutal, yet it taught me that not everything is worth making a lot of fuss. Because one day I may really need help and no one will come. The same here when people pull the race or sexism card on almost everything.- Emerald We have a similar story about a boy who shouted there was a wolf when there wasn’t and when there was, no one believed him and he got eaten.~ Mulan Except right now the wolves are regularly devouring sheep and the foxes are feating on chickens. So I hope that before we get sick of it the farmers will take care of the wolf and fox problem."

Nevertheless the UK government in its infinite wisdom held it necessary that I actually get a British license, theory practical and all. But only after a year, because that long my license is considered valid in the UK. Ok, I thought, I can do that and went on to do them. No problem. What did get me though is that my car insurance company was aware of all of this. So when I informed them, as I was obliged to, that I had indeed confirmed fully with the law, they decided this would be a good opportunity to increase my car insurance by a factor of 3.5. After all, I had just gotten my license and could not drive worth shit having only 1 day of experience. Several freak-outs and polite invectives later that is now my former insurer. I then found myself a new company. It&rsquo;s a bit more expensive than my previous one (+50% or a factor of 1.5) but still cheaper than the £&amp;@€$# previous one. Which leaves me with just one question: Who defecated into their cerebrae? What kind of numb-scull would think that&rsquo;s a solid way to do business?"

Your vote can make a difference and it is important for young people to have their say in how our country is governed. Don’t think it will make a difference? Last time there was a general election, I was 15 years old and on the brink of sitting my GCSEs. I could barely wrap my head around starting A-Levels, but I knew that a university education might be on the cards for me a few years down the line. Fast forward to today, and I’m 2 weeks away from finishing my undergraduate degree which I have been studying for since Autumn 2012. As a result of the previous general election in 2010, I now pay triple the amount of tuition fees than students who entered the year before me. The election matters.My point is the election does matter and we can have a say in that through our votes. When I vote today, I know first that politics has a direct influence on my life, my work and my education. Please, if you’re registered to vote, head down to your designated polling station before 10pm today (7th May 2015) and cast your vote. Thank you. Yes, please do vote if you are eligible and registered! This is my second general election and fourth election overall, so I guess I’m kinda a keen (and old) voter but it is SO important!The number of people who don’t vote out numbers the number of people who vote for any one of the big parties.Imagine what could change if nonvoters started to vote!And seeing as nonvoters tend to be young people, things could change in our favour! Plus if you don&rsquo;t vote when you could I think you loose your right to bitch about anything in the country!"

Let me tell you something, the single thing, that all successful people have in common: they all like what they are doing. Now I get that &ldquo;being successful&rdquo; may not be the best measurement, after all it leaves out a whole lot of stuff. So let&rsquo;s look at it from a totally different angle. The socialist ideal held that you should spend 8 hours of every day with work, 8 with leisure and 8 with sleep. If you take away the sleep time, where you are more or less unconscious then that leaves you with spending HALF your waking hours working. And that&rsquo;s under ideal circumstances! In modern reality it&rsquo;s probably even more. So if you are spending more than half your waking hours at something you dislike, then that&rsquo;s a problem. Of course I realise that there are external pressures that force us all to maybe do things we don&rsquo;t like. But still if this is a persistent theme, it&rsquo;s a problem. If you ever want a chance to actually like your life, if ever you want a chance to actually be happy, you better find a way to enjoy working by whatever means. One thing is for certain: &ldquo;oh no I have to go to work tomorrow&rdquo; is a recipe for failing at happiness whatever else you do."

Something like this is incredibly hard to investigate and to draw valid conclusions from. And the French prosecutor Brice Robin has made it even harder. While it&rsquo;s entirely possible that Andreas Lubitz did in fact willfully crash a plane full of people into a mountain, there are actually a number of alternative explanations (even without descending into conspiracy theories) for what happened. There has never been an actually fail-safe system. Things go wrong on a pretty regular basis. Alas, by talking to the press after only two days, claiming that the cause of this disaster was malice, the prosecutor is acting negligently. Unless there is significantly more evidence pointing to malice than the fact that Lubitz was heard breathing, this is a classic case of jumping to conclusions. No one is looking at whether the door actually was defective; no one is looking into whether it is actually possible that a confluence of other events could have lead to this outcome. And if there was actually some other cause, which led to an unconcious man hitting the right buttons and resting on them, we&rsquo;ll never know. After all, at this point no one is actually looking into anything other than possible medical and psychological reasons for Andreas Lubitz to have intentionally crashed this plane. Not because these things are unknowable, but because no one will be looking. By making his statement so early on in the investigation, an investigation that most expected to take months or years, prosecutor Robin has preempted any actual investigation. This is incredibly negligent and should serve as a warning for the future. You never preempt an investigation into a problem; You never proclaim conclusions without solid evidence. And the fact that breathing could be heard is insufficient evidence. Unconscious people still breathe. So we are now left to hope, that Mr. Robin was actually right and this was a case of intentional malice; because if it was not, then there is a dangerous defect that could potentially cause more accidents and deaths."

My grandfather told me this joke when I was younger and it stuck with me. It’s a joke that is quite dated as it stems from my grandfather’s youth in the 1920s and 1930s. Teacher: Class, can you name three of the most important scientists and cultural luminaries of Austria?Student: Does it have to be a goy? What does this joke from before WWII tell me who was born in the last quarter of the 20th century? It tells me that Austria used to be rich! Rich in culture, rich in science, rich in philosophy! Rich because the Jews of Austria brought to it their own cultural heritage and influences to make for a unique and exciting collage that made Austria better. And then a spiteful xenophobe from Austria went to Germany to bring his brand of hatred to the fore. He came back to Austria in 1938 and was welcomed as its saviour. He was still welcomed when he began to systematically slaughter more than 6 million Jews and anyone else that did not fit his ideal. Many joined him in his savagery. In the end he was defeated, but his insanity, shared by many, left a scar on Europe that is still visible, that still hurts, today. It left Austria poorer. Poorer not of finances as that was quickly overcome, but poorer of culture, of science, of philosophy. Today there are very few Jews left in Austria. And the few that remain still attempt to remain inconspicuous lest some old time hate mongers or their mental descendants attack them again. They know there would be little help or protection were that to occur. Britain is nowhere near as hateful as Austria in the 30s and 40s, but even though there is a pervasive air of anti-semitism that is beginning to trigger Jewish flight instincts. No one expects another holocaust or pogroms - least of all in Britain, but the basic ingredient of hatred is there. Britain has an exciting and colourful culture influenced by the many people that flocked to it from all corners of the empire. Imagine a London where you could not get a decent curry, because there are no Indians because they fled. That is what Austria feels like today and it is what Britain will feel like if it does not protect its minorities and sheds its anti-semitism and xenophobia. That is what Britain will feel like if it concedes ground to sentiments like “Britain for the British”. Britain has a long history of absorbing new influences and taking the best out of them to make it its own. Keep that tradition and live by it; don’t let haters of any stripe control Britains destiny."

When they bolt, or only return his advances with polite smiles that look like fence posts too high for even him to jump, he sighs. He tells them he is a god, and his words echo back to him, accompanied by laughter. No one believes him He picks up his wife, who might be his sister in this time, in a beat up car with a beautiful flame job, Hera is a marriage counselor with peacock feather bags under her eyes, her advice falls on her own deaf ears as her jealous eyes roam over every girl they pass, and she is right to. She knows this. She has always known. Poseidon’s hands are rough and calloused, he raises cargo too heavy for a man his age, the young ones say. He laughs his fisherman’s laugh, all depths and riptide, because no one should be his age. He reminds himself he is one of the lucky ones, he gets to be around what he loves. He may not have his dominion any more, but salt water and sun still weather his face. Hades stalks the streets at night, women cross the street to avoid him, and he smiles with his needle-teeth, they are right to. This winter he is without a bride, and he still wants to usher souls into the afterlife, the pistol hangs heavy in his pocket, his tongue glints gold, the coin to pay his Charon, his most loyal employee. He brings knives to gunfights and guns to fistfights, he stands with his arms out like their new God, these fickle humans, he welcomes the bullets. He dares them to kill him. They try. Ares and Athena spit curses laced with whiskey from across dive bar floors, they are moving human pawns across a chessboard. They were strategists before they were gangsters, but it doesn’t matter now. Apollo sings in a nightclub, his crooning voice from a forgotten time. He has his sister’s blood under his fingernails, from stitching up wound after wound, Artemis forgets she is not invincible anymore. He sings about the moon and wonders where she is, picking a fight with some would-be rapist, maybe it’s Zeus. It’s probably Zeus. Again. Dionysus drinks away their shared pain, dealing LSD in dark alleyways, he whispers sweet promises and his followers believe him, he was human once and he can be again, like wine, he knew nothing so sweet could have lasted forever. Icarus sidles up to his side, asking if he’s got anything that can make you feel like you can fly. In this life, he is a junkie, and Daedalus watches with ancient, sad eyes. Icarus is melting and Dionysus is letting him. Hestia sits by the hearth and waits for her family to come home. And she listens while they all curse their immortality. She shakes her head slow and clicks her tongue, I know, my darlings, I know. Are gods really gods if no one believes in them anymore? Does it matter?"

That way we’d be rewarding the success and even if you flunked the semester, you still wouldn’t have to pay for ALL of the tuition You are the future. Please run for president that would actually be amazing That would actually be really bad, because they need that money. So they would then have an interest in you failing. You can bet that they would instruct the professors to grade in such a way that only the very top would even get 60%. In addition they would raise tuition by 200% to make up the difference, except that means a lot of people could not take the risk of getting a bad grade, because that would be expensive. So then you&rsquo;d just take classes you are already good at, because you&rsquo;d get good grades without hassle rather than classes that teach something new, because those are risky. Imagine finding out you suck at something. That 20% grade is going to really ruin you summer, because in addition to making it up you&rsquo;ll need a really well paying summer job to pay off that class. So you see this might not be that great an idea after all."

I&rsquo;m a white middle aged male and I&rsquo;m sick of it! Now before you go all apeshit at me, let me explain what I mean. More than a century ago slaves were freed and it became law that truly all men should be equal. Almost 100 years ago, women got the vote and it was established into law that there is gender equality. About 50 years ago it was reiterated that race should not be a criterion. And in 2014 youths are being shot simply for being black-skinned, women are molested simply for walking down the street, people run scared because their gender identity doesn&rsquo;t match what some scatterbrained ass thinks it should. I don&rsquo;t want a world where race is an issue. I don&rsquo;t want a world where gender is an issue. I don&rsquo;t want a world where people have to be rightfully scared simply because of who they are. I want a world where race is what it is, an evolutionary characteristic of ones DNA. I want a world where gender is part accident at birth. Where gender identity is truly irrelevant because no one cares what you identify as and just people accept your word for it. Now I realise that this is not the world we live in, but I want it to be the world we strive for. A world where I don&rsquo;t hear about race-discrimination or rape-culture because there is no such thing. Now until we have such a world keep screaming and protesting and ranting. I might not want to hear it, but we have to hear it if we ever want to get over that crap."

		"title": "Another myth that is firmly upheld is that disabled people are dependent and non-disabled people are independent. No one is actually independent. This is a myth perpetuated by disablism and driven by capitalism - we are all actually interdependent. Chances are, disabled or not, you don’t grow all of your food. Chances are, you didn’t build the car, bike, wheelchair, subway, shoes, or bus that transports you. Chances are you didn’t construct your home. Chances are you didn’t sew your clothing (or make the fabric and thread used to sew it). The difference between the needs that many disabled people have and the needs of people who are not labelled as disabled is that non-disabled people have had their dependencies normalized. The world has been built to accommodate certain needs and call the people who need those things independent, while other needs are considered exceptional. Each of us relies on others every day. We all rely on one another for support, resources, and to meet our needs. We are all interdependent. This interdependence is not weakness; rather, it is a part of our humanity."

Live with short hair for a while. It’ll grow. You won’t always want to talk to people. That’s okay. When it’s late and you hear your friends talking in the next room, you don’t have to join them. You’re allowed your solitude. It makes company sweeter and it teaches you how to survive alone. You will need that skill. In the winter, you’ll believe that nothing will ever grow again. You’re wrong. Every year, London looks like it’s on its last legs, wheezing through those last cold days in March. Every year, spring comes like an explosion and the city shakes off its sleep. Mundane problems will get the better of you sometimes. Don’t worry. Try as you might, life cannot be an endless, beautiful, intense moment. Find comfort in money worries and late trains; they’re a welcome rest in between heartbreaks and breakdowns. People will call you a cynic, a wry smile on their faces. Pay them no mind. You alone know that you are capable of a love greater than anything they can comprehend. You alone know that you are not willing to sell your identity and respect to the first smirking halfwit to pass by. It is not cynicism. It is reverence for your own vast and fathomless heart, and it makes sense only to love someone who understands that and is awed by it. You will not always get what you want when you want it. Accept it. Your goals are not set in stone and you are not on a fixed trajectory. Sometimes, life will take its time and you will have to play the long, interminable game. Play it well and with as much grace as you can muster. Live at your own pace. At night, you will occasionally wake up afraid, wanting to die. Don’t give in. Night plays its tricks, but you are not so easily fooled. Your mind will play its tricks, too. It will make you believe that you’re not who you are, but you must not give in. You take a breath and you tell yourself that you are here. That you always were."

If anything, Robin Williams&rsquo; suicide is another reminder that all the talent and humor in the world is no match for the power and darkness of depression. The way I see it, if you can fight off depression for 63 years and make others laugh and feel good, you are one courageous dude."

He did it so well, that you could even see the lighting up if the eyes. But he was ultimately unsuccessful at convincing himself. The question that I would now ask, now that we are deprived of Robin Williams particular genius, is whether on balance the world is now happier or sadder off as a whole. Now the answer may seem obvious: we are collectively sad. But I think that this would be the wrong answer. That is because we can still enjoy the many gifts Robin has given us. There are even some that have not yet been released. On the other hand we now lack the incredible pain and sadness that filled him. By taking that away the world truly has become a happier place."

The public safety of our city is of paramount importance, particularly our landmarks and bridges that are already known to be high-risk targets. We will not surrender our public safety to anyone, at any time. Political and social expression, whatever its message may be, has a place in our society, but not at the expense of others’ security. I am confident in the NYPD’s ability to investigate this matter. Now I don&rsquo;t know about you, but if some punks manage to climb the bridge and paint a flag white, then you don&rsquo;t really have any public safety there and the punk has simply showed you off as an absolute failure. So rather than berate them he should have said: I thank these punks for showing us that we are failing in protecting landmarks and bridges that are already known to be high-risk targets. I vow to do better. Give me 3 months. If this happens ever again after that, I will resign immediately. So dear NYPD, stop wasting your time looking for the perps. They were helping you see that you are not doing your job."

I’ve heard that you donated all your £153 pocket money savings to my Prizeo fundraiser on behalf of the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary. I cannot tell you how much that moved me. It pleases me no end to know that my novels, and the TV series based on them, have inspired readers as young as yourself to rally to the support of these majestic and too often stigmatized animals Alas, I cannot promise you a grisly death in THE WIND OF WINTER. Those spots have already been filled by some very generous donors, and there’s a limit to how many people even I can kill. However, inspired by your example, my friends at Prizeo and I would love to follow your lead with a $10,000 in your name to the UK Wolf Conservation Trust. That’s a wonderful organization that I’ve heard much about, and they are lucky to count people like you as supporters. I wish you the best of luck in your future career as a wolf conservationist, and hope that you inspire many others to follow your lead. Yours, GRRM"

They seemed like the ant carrying the apple in the cartoons, except without any of the grace of the ant. Suppressing my instinct to just pick up a box and carry it in I found it a challenge to accept that I was not welcome in their lair. Yet the fact that such places are needed is made abundantly clear by the radiating suspicion of these women. This is likely the only situation I have actually experienced where I could glimpse what any minority experiences full force: the combination of overt welcome and covert distrust and dislike. So while I would discourage white males to go around the local women&rsquo;s shelter for the experience, if you ever get the chance then pay attention to all the subliminal things going on.

(i.e., “stealing” a free public education). Shanesha Taylor, another single homeless mother, had no one to watch her two small children, so she left them in the car during a job interview. She got the job — and then returned to find the cops waiting for her. (The district attorney in Scottsdale, Arizona, has now agreed to dismiss the charges, as long as Taylor completes parenting courses, and establishes education and child-care trust funds for her kids.) In all three cases mothers were separated from their children for the act of mothering."

There is no such thing as &ldquo;Palestinians&rdquo; since there is no such country as &ldquo;Palestine&rdquo;. An person from Gaza or the West-Bank attacking Israel is nothing more than a vile terrorist. You see, there are at least two sides to the story. And being that there are currently missiles being shot at Israel, tunnels with weapons being found, and missiles demonstrably being hidden in schools, there is very little sympathy for Palestinians. So until Palestinians realise that Hamas, in their goal of violent destruction of Israel, does not serve them they are the biggest obstacle to their own safety."

Austria/Germany provided the world with visible and horrific proof of this in the 20th century, but one should not be tricked into believing that the rest of Europe, or America for that matter, is any less antisemitic. Had there been only slightly different circumstances antisemitism may well have overflowed elsewhere. The world was well aware of the murderous plans for Jews forged in Germany; after all Hitler used them as propaganda throughout his reign. Neither America nor the rest of Europe was entirely unsympathetic; to Germany that is. Jews, and anyone in sympathy with humanity in general, should be grateful to Japanese stupidity, and the fact that Germany happened to be in alliance with Japan, in attacking Pearl Harbor. Otherwise it may well be that Nazi-Germany would have succeeded in exterminating all Jews. After the war the international community was horrified at its own blithe inaction and blatant negligence. Like a child beginning to cry in view of the deliberately murdered goldfish on the carpet the victors of WWII decided to ease their consciences by creating the modern state of Israel. However one should not make the mistake of believing that Europe and the world at large had become any less antisemitic. Antisemitism simply became a subliminal principle rather than an openly celebrated attitude. Given this prevailing antisemitism it is almost incredible how inept the handling of world politics by Palestinians in particular, but Muslims in general, has been. After all, until the era of islamic terrorism, antisemitism had almost been sufficient to reduce Israel to a sliver of its current size and prowess. The muslim world has instead managed to alienate the rest of the world by continually denying Israel&rsquo;s right to exist. Independent of the value of any claims pro or contra the legitimate existence of Israel, there is simply no way that any nation involved in WWII would every deny the right of Israel&rsquo;s existence for it would be tantamount to acknowledging the at least passive complicity in the slaughter and extermination of millions of jews. At this point the existence of Israel is a historic fact whose legitimacy can, and should, no longer be challenged. So long as Palestinians do not unequivocally accept the right of Israel to exist and denounce any person or entity not doing the same there cannot be peace. Which brings up a thought that may close the circle: With the way Islamists have been acting, and Palestinians are acting right now, islamophobia will indubitably turn into islamomisia and then into straight out anti-islamism if we aren&rsquo;t already there. The world is uniquely adept at blithely ignoring genocide if it&rsquo;s in line with it&rsquo;s own anti-sentiments. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time until this world is willing to sit back and watch a Palestinian genocide unfold. The only reason that both sides are being asked for restraint is the deep rooted antisemitism in the western world. If it were not Israel but any other state being attacked, the rest of the world would simply make popcorn and sit back to watch the mayhem unfold. So if Palestinians want to have even the thread of a chance of survival, they will have to simply accept, that Israel has a right to exists unmolested. As soon as they do, they will find that all the other issues are pretty easy to get an accord on."

You must be over the age where you need a pacifier-pocket.My theory is that since women have realised that they don&rsquo;t really need men, and can just keep one around as a plaything while they are infatuated, we men have conspired to create an artificial dependence.

Both went on to quickly prove that they are utterly incompatible with humanity. To call either &ldquo;legitimate authority&rdquo; is sort of irrelevant in view of the damage wrought then and being inflicted today. Nations and states tried in the 1930s to appease and work with Nazi-Germany. Nations and states tried the entire 21st century to appease and work with Hamas-Palestine. The main difference is that Nazi-Germany had significantly more man- and firepower, so the scale of the damage wrought is on a quite different level; though the lesson remains the same: appeasement is not really a recipe for success. I define stupidity as: attempting identical actions and expecting different outcomes. While one can admire Israel&rsquo;s restraint and humanity, by the definition above Israel is quite stupid; so is Hamas. After decades of seeing terrorism and aggression fail to achieve anything of significance, it might be a good idea to rethink the strategy. Isn&rsquo;t it about time the world made it clear that denying Israel&rsquo;s right to exists is not a viable option? Isn&rsquo;t it time to reevaluate whether the IDF&rsquo;s reticence to inflict civilian harm isn&rsquo;t causing much more and prolonged suffering? One thing is abundantly clear: continuing with the status quo will simply cause more suffering and more victims and more bitterness, while never leading to a resolution."

		"title": "I did things in my 30s that were ignored by the world, that could have been quickly labeled a failure. Here’s a classic example; in 1974 I did a movie called Phantom of the Paradise. Phantom of the Paradise, which was a huge flop in this country. There were only two cities in the world where it had any real success: Winnipeg, in Canada, and Paris, France. So, okay, let’s write it off as a failure. Maybe you could do that. But all of the sudden, I’m in Mexico, and a 16-year-old boy comes up to me at a concert with an album - a Phantom of the Paradise soundtrack- and asks me to sign it. I sign it. Evidently I was nice to him and we had a nice little conversation. I don’t remember the moment, I remember signing the album (I don’t know if I think I remember or if I actually remember). But this little 14 or 16, whatever old this guy was… Well I know who the guy is now because I’m writing a musical based on Pan’s Labyrinth; it’s Guillermo del Toro. The work that I’ve done with Daft Punk it’s totally related to them seeing Phantom of the Paradise 20 times and deciding they’re going to reach out to this 70-year-old songwriter to get involved in an album called Random Access Memories. So, what is the lesson in that? The lesson for me is being very careful about what you label a failure in your life. Be careful about throwing something in the round file as garbage because you may find that it’s the headwaters of a relationship that you can’t even imagine it’s coming in your future."

That way we’d be rewarding the success and even if you flunked the semester, you still wouldn’t have to pay for ALL of the tuition You are the future. That&rsquo;s sort of like my get the vote out scheme: Set the income tax at 95% and give people that show up to vote a tax voucher that takes taxes down to where they are now. Same thing would happen to tuitions rather than costing and arm and a leg, they cost two arms and two legs.

For years I have been talking of leaving the country and moving somewhere else. This spring life dealt me a hand that allowed me to go for it. It looked hard into my eyes and said: &ldquo;I think you have been bluffing&rdquo; Well now we had to make a choice and we showed our hand. Well we are winning that game. I found a job in London. The last two weeks we were there to find a place to live, a school for the kids, and do a lot the administrative tasks. London treated us like a charm. A city is so different when you are there with a view toward staying. And then our time was up. It was back to Austria for a week before going on our holiday to the US that we had planned/booked for like a year. Being in London felt like winning that game of poker. I could almost feel the chips on my arms as I proverbially shovelled them toward me with every step in setting up life there. Leaving London felt awful, because I had to give all those chips back to the croupier, watching lovingly as they go back to the office. No I&rsquo;m just sitting here, waiting for them to come out with the actual winnings. I so can&rsquo;t wait to go back and actually live there!"

This argument finally is a cogent argument that the time of the abortion or when life actually starts is totally irrelevant. Finally someone is arguing in a way that eliminates the tedious discussion on when life begins. And it&rsquo;s finally an argument that, while we men may want to educate ourselves about the issues and be as supportive as we can be, our opinion on abortion is (or at least should be) ultimately irrelevant."

The universe is simply a sealed, twisting kaleidoscope that has reordered itself a trillion trillion trillion times over. Each baby, then, is a unique collision - a cocktail, a remix - of all that has come before: made from molecules of Napoleon and stardust and comets and whale tooth; colloidal mercury and Cleopatra’s breath: and with the same darkness that is between the stars between, and inside, our own atoms. When you know this, you suddenly see the crowded top deck of the bus, in the rain, as a miracle: this collection of people is by way of a starburst constellation. Families are bright, irregular-shaped nebulae. Finding a person you love is like galaxies colliding. We are all peculiar, unrepeatable, perambulating micro-universes - we have never been before and we will never be again. Oh God, the sheer exuberant, unlikely face of our existences. The honour of being alive. They will never be able to make you again. Don’t you dare waste a second of it thinking something better will happen when it ends. Don’t you dare."

Now she wears nail polish more often and I get to spend my evenings and weekends doing her nails. I guess it&rsquo;s true what they say: never let anyone see you having skills at something you do not absolutely live doing, or you&rsquo;ll be doing it for the rest of your life."

I told them that I am moving a family of 4 people and I told them my housing budget. One would expect, that the reaction is a statement about possible areas to move to. What I got instead was a list of the 10 most expensive areas in London and the statement that I might not want to look for a 3 bedroom place there but rather for a 1 bedroom. My head was like: do we need to practice basic listening comprehension? Hello, family of 4 not going to happen with a 1 bedroom. After all, I actually still love my wife and am not playing golf yet. So I specifically ask: &ldquo;OK, since you know London better than me, maybe you could suggest some areas, that will fit both my budgetary and space needs&rdquo;. Which is definitely possible, since my rental budget is roughly the national average gross salary, and there are potential properties to be found via zoopla.co.uk Any case. They said they&rsquo;d research that. Now I just received another document from them, which gives a &ldquo;Market Overview&rdquo; of ??? You guessed it! The 10 most expensive areas of London! So I guess it&rsquo;ll be up to me actually research and locate a place to live. I have no idea yet what the point of that relocation service then really is, but I am determined to find out. I am pretty sure, that they do actually provide something of value, I just don&rsquo;t quite know what yet."

The fact that it&rsquo;s raining means there is water in the sky. Big surprise. So what? Let me tell you something. Most people get exactly the amount of respect from others that they give themselves. Thing is: that can be both good and bad. If a woman doesn&rsquo;t have any respect for herself, she&rsquo;s more likely to be in an abusive relationship; a woman in an abusive relationship is also less likely to have/gain any respect for herself. On the other hand. A woman that is self-confident and respects herself (and other women, which happens to be the definition of feminism), is more likely to be in a supportive and respectful relationship. And a woman in a supportive relationship is much more likely to respect herself. So rather than spout quaint deprecatory snark, maybe it&rsquo;s time to realise that you get what you ask for. If you ask all shy and scared: &ldquo;Honey would it turn you off if labeled myself a feminist?&rdquo; and then be surprised if he says yes it may just be time to realise that for every man out there that finds feminism a turn off, there are two dozen that find a strong self-respecting female partner the biggest turn on there is. So rather than being self deprecatory and at the same time complain about douche-bags, maybe realise that likely as not you are right just the way you are and assert that. Then maybe you don&rsquo;t have to yammer as much."

Taking things apart, or taking people down, can provide the satisfactions of cynicism. But this is thin gruel. The skill at unmasking error, or simple intellectual one-upmanship, is not totally without value, but we should be wary of creating a class of self-satisfied debunkers"

I wish Austria was as accepting, yet in reality Austria is more homophobic than most other countries in Europe. Well why then, you ask, would they send Conchita Wurst to the song contest? Actually it&rsquo;s as simple as it is sad. No one cares about Eurovision. It has zero effect on anything, so it does not matter one bit who sings there. At the same time, the world is growing ever more accepting. There are people even asking for marriage equality, how dare they. Austria is using Conchita a fig leaf. Now they can refuse any real policy of acceptance, anything truly meaningful, and at the same time lay a claim to being a forward thinking place. So while I would love to live I a society that was truly accepting, Austria is not it. So how can we prevent this from becoming a phyrric victory? We have to force ahead and now ask for real change rather than just for show."

What I did instead is report the problem. I marked it, described the precise issue and jumped through all their hoops. In the end I was notified that my input was now part of Google Maps. YIPPEEH!!! Today I asked Google Maps again for directions. And guess what, it made the same goddamn mistake again. Not similar, THE FUCKING SAME MISTAKE that leads you down the wrong side of a highway. The same fucking mistake, that I fucking helped them fix more than a year ago. Now in my book, when you make a potentially dangerous error, that&rsquo;s a mistake; if you are told and don&rsquo;t fix it, it&rsquo;s negligence; if you are told, and claim to have fixed it and don&rsquo;t, then that&rsquo;s gross negligence. And guess what. Gross negligence makes you liable even if you disclaim liability. Watch out Google, this is the way companies get sued into oblivion and I&rsquo;d hate that."

Since that person is on the other end of the world, I was thinking Starbucks gift card. Well they do that, except they need an email address to send the voucher to. So at that point I asked for their email address. I had no interest in actually getting their email address. I don&rsquo;t really know them after all, but I do enjoy their blog and wanted to send them a gift card. Well that&rsquo;s over and it didn&rsquo;t work out, which is fine, but it got me thinking about avoiding handing out email addresses, be it to sites you register with or to people you don&rsquo;t know. And I realised that not everyone knows how to get a temporary e-mail address for that purpose. So here comes my &ldquo;Public Service Announcement&rdquo;: There are actually services out there like MeltMail, where you enter your real email address, and they will give you an email address that will work for anywhere between 3 hours and a day. Alternatively you could use AirMail which works as long as you keep your browser window open. It really is that simple. While it&rsquo;s not protecting your identity, against molochs such as the NSA, it is sufficient to protect you against spam and random stalkers. So play with it and see what mischief you can create ;)"

I was debating whether making a pot of Folgers or just a cup of instant yesterday and now I know that the answer is always instant. This is actually a saddening post. The choice between Folgers and instant? That&rsquo;s like choosing between pest and cholera?How about selecting between different roasts prepared as espresso?

		"title": "To all those who don’t think the rape joke was a problem, or rape jokes are a problem. I get it, you’re a decent guy. I can even believe it. You’ve never raped anybody. You would NEVER rape anybody. You’re upset that all these feminists are trying to accuse you of doing something or connect you to doing something that, as far as you’re concerned, you’ve never done and would never condone. And they’ve told you about triggers, and PTSD, and how one in six women is a survivor, and you get it. You do. But you can’t let every time someone gets all upset get in the way of you having a good time, right? So fine. If all those arguments aren’t going anything for you, let me tell you this. And I tell you this because I genuinely believe you mean it when you say you don’t want to hurt anybody, and you don’t see the harm, and that it’s important to you to do your best to be a decent and good person. And I genuinely believe you when you say you would never associate with a rapist and you think rape really is a very bad thing. Because this is why I refuse to take rape jokes sitting down- 6% of college age men, slightly over 1 in 20, will admit to raping someone in anonymous surveys, as long as the word “rape” isn’t used in the description of the act. 6% of Penny Arcade’s target demographic will admit to actually being rapists when asked. A lot of people accuse feminists of thinking that all men are rapists. That’s not true. But do you know who think all men are rapists? Rapists do. They really do. In psychological study, the profiling, the studies, it comes out again and again. Virtually all rapists genuinely believe that all men rape, and other men just keep it hushed up better. And more, these people who really are rapists are constantly reaffirmed in their belief about the rest of mankind being rapists like them by things like rape jokes, that dismiss and normalize the idea of rape. If one in twenty guys is a real and true rapist, and you have any amount of social activity with other guys like yourself, really cool guy, then it is almost a statistical certainty that one time hanging out with friends and their friends, playing Halo with a bunch of guys online, in a WoW guild, or elsewhere, you were talking to a rapist. Not your fault. You can’t tell a rapist apart any better than anyone else can. It’s not like they announce themselves. But, here’s the thing. It’s very likely that in some of these interactions with these guys, at some point or another someone told a rape joke. You, decent guy that you are, understood that they didn’t mean it, and it was just a joke. And so you laughed. And, decent guy who would never condone rape, who would step in and stop rape if he saw it, who understands that rape is awful and wrong and bad, when you laughed? That rapist who was in the group with you, that rapist thought that you were on his side. That rapist knew that you were a rapist like him. And he felt validated, and he felt he was among his comrades. You. The rapist’s comrade. And if that doesn’t make you feel sick to your stomach, if that doesn’t make you want to throw up, if that doesn’t disturb you or bother you or make you feel like maybe you should at least consider not participating in that kind of humor anymore… Well, maybe you aren’t as opposed to rapists as you claim."

This was a perfect politician answer: Repeat the statement of the question (there are people disrespecting their parents) Switch topics by making a loosley related statement (some parents abuse their kids) Give a quanswer (question framed as an answer) about your own statement (I don’t get kids respecting their abusive parents) And presto, question has been evaded without an answer.

Part of the fun of reading to your kids, after all, is in sharing the stories you loved as a child. And in the story I knew, Bilbo was a boy. A boy hobbit. (Whatever that entails.) But my daughter was determined. She liked the story pretty well so far, but Bilbo was definitely a girl. So would I please start reading the book the right way? I hesitated. I imagined Tolkien spinning in his grave. I imagined mean letters from his testy estate. I imagined the story getting as lost in gender distinctions as dwarves in the Mirkwood. Then I thought: What the hell, it’s just a pronoun. My daughter wants Bilbo to be a girl, so a girl she will be. And you know what? The switch was easy. Bilbo, it turns out, makes a terrific heroine. She’s tough, resourceful, humble, funny, and uses her wits to make off with a spectacular piece of jewelry. Perhaps most importantly, she never makes an issue of her gender—and neither does anyone else."

If we have sons, we don’t mind knowing about our sons’ girlfriends, but our daughters boyfriends? ‘God forbid!’ But of course when the time is right, we expect those girls to bring back the perfect man to be their husband.

If you pull over to help a woman whose car has broken down, remember not to rape her. 4. If you are in an elevator and a woman gets in, don’t rape her. 5. When you encounter a woman who is asleep, the safest course of action is to not rape her. 6. Never creep into a woman’s home through an unlocked door or window, or spring out at her from between parked cars, or rape her. 7. Remember, people go to the laundry room to do their laundry. Do not attempt to molest someone who is alone in a laundry room. 8. Use the Buddy System! If it is inconvenient for you to stop yourself from raping women, ask a trusted friend to accompany you at all times. 9. Carry a rape whistle. If you find that you are about to rape someone, blow the whistle until someone comes to stop you. 10. Don’t forget: Honesty is the best policy. When asking a woman out on a date, don’t pretend that you are interested in her as a person; tell her straight up that you expect to be raping her later. If you don’t communicate your intentions, the woman may take it as a sign that you do not plan to rape her."

		"title": "For years, I opened my 11th-grade U.S. history classes by asking students, “What’s the name of that guy they say discovered America?” A few students might object to the word “discover,” but they all knew the fellow I was talking about. “Christopher Columbus!” several called out in unison.“Right. So who did he find when he came here?” I asked. Usually, a few students would say, “Indians,” but I asked them to be specific: “Which nationality? What are their names?”Silence.In more than 30 years of teaching U.S. history and guest-teaching in others’ classes, I’ve never had a single student say, “Taínos.” How do we explain that? We all know the name of the man who came here from Europe, but none of us knows the name of the people who were here first—and there were hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of them. Why haven’t you heard of them?This ignorance is an artifact of historical silencing—rendering invisible the lives and stories of entire peoples.[…] In an interview with Barbara Miner, included in Rethinking Columbus, Suzan Shown Harjo of the Morning Star Institute, who is Creek and Cheyenne, said: “As Native American peoples in this red quarter of Mother Earth, we have no reason to celebrate an invasion that caused the demise of so many of our people, and is still causing destruction today.” After all, Columbus did not merely “discover,” he took over. He kidnapped Taínos, enslaved them—“Let us in the name of the Holy Trinity go on sending all the slaves that can be sold,” Columbus wrote—and “punished” them by ordering that their hands be cut off or that they be chased down by vicious attack dogs, if they failed to deliver the quota of gold that Columbus demanded. One eyewitness accompanying Columbus wrote that it “did them great damage, for a dog is the equal of 10 men against the Indians.”Corporate textbooks and children’s biographies of Columbus included none of this and were filled with misinformation and distortion. But the deeper problem was the subtext of the Columbus story: it’s OK for big nations to bully small nations, for white people to dominate people of color, to celebrate the colonialists with no attention paid to the perspectives of the colonized, to view history solely from the standpoint of the winners."

Woofles didn’t even approach it when I set it down, as I hadn’t told him it was okay to do so. Quinn approached it, completely ready to take it from the plate (as her manners are not yet as good as Woofles’ manners), was told no, and immediately backed off. When Woofles heard the no, he turned away as well because he knew that steak was not for him to eat. Notice how they didn’t ‘argue’, didn’t take it anyway, didn’t get aggressive, didn’t beg, or didn’t try to somehow persuade me that they should be able to have it. They were told no, they backed off. So, essentially, if you use that analogy to excuse rape, you’re saying you have less self control and fewer basic social manners than my two dogs. That also probably means you should be neutered and kept on a leash. "

They’re addicted to each other,” Boyd says. “They’re not allowed to hang out the way you and I did, so they’ve moved it online.” It’s true. As a teenager in the early ’80s I could roam pretty widely with my friends, as long as we were back by dark. But over the next three decades, the media began delivering a metronomic diet of horrifying but rare child-abduction stories, and parents shortened the leash on their kids. Politicians warned of incipient waves of youth wilding and superpredators (neither of which emerged). Municipalities crafted anti-loitering laws and curfews to keep young people from congregating alone. New neighborhoods had fewer public spaces. Crime rates plummeted, but moral panic soared. Meanwhile, increased competition to get into college meant well-off parents began heavily scheduling their kids’ after-school lives. The result, Boyd discovered, is that today’s teens have neither the time nor the freedom to hang out. So their avid migration to social media is a rational response to a crazy situation. They’d rather socialize F2F, so long as it’s unstructured and away from grown-ups. “I don’t care where,” one told Boyd wistfully, “just not home."

Thing is, it&rsquo;s not enough to simply divide the ingredients by 4. I mean what the heck is &frac14; dash of salt? Also a lot of things like gratins go into the oven in a form. Yeah you can take a smaller form, but that also means less depth and less surface area. So for some things that can throw off your oven time by like 100%. For other things it doesn&rsquo;t change timing, because it actually just needs time. So often on the first try I cook too much. But since most of the time I cook for myself only, since my family is decidedly not goin keto, I have to eat it myself. Problem there is that I am actually a pretty good cook, which means the stuff i make usually tastes amazing (at least to me), so not eating it all is really hard. Well any case, if you have any good low-carb (as in ultra low) recipes designed for one person, please write them up and submit them. I&rsquo;m going to publish them and do a collection of them. Thanks all!"

This is your choice, of course, but don’t kid yourself: it’s also the flinch. Your personality is not set in stone. You may think a morning coffee is the most enjoyable thing in the world, but it’s really just a habit. Thirty days without it, and you would be fine. You think you have a soul mate, but in fact you could have had any number of spouses. You would have evolved differently, but been just as happy. You can change what you want about yourself at any time. You see yourself as someone who can’t write or play an instrument, who gives in to temptation or makes bad decisions, but that’s really not you. It’s not ingrained. It’s not your personality. Your personality is something else, something deeper than just preferences, and these details on the surface, you can change anytime you like. If it is useful to do so, you must abandon your identity and start again. Sometimes, it’s the only way. Set fire to your old self. It’s not needed here. It’s too busy shopping, gossiping about others, and watching days go by and asking why you haven’t gotten as far as you’d like. This old self will die and be forgotten by all but family, and replaced by someone who makes a difference. Your new self is not like that. Your new self is the Great Chicago Fire—overwhelming, overpowering, and destroying everything that isn’t necessary."

But if we explore its paradoxes, we find that quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square and a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig. And why is it that writers write but fingers don’t fing, grocers don’t groce and hammers don’t ham? If the plural of tooth is teeth, why isn’t the plural of booth beeth? One goose, 2 geese. So one moose, 2 meese? One index, 2 indices? Doesn’t it seem crazy that you can make amends but not one amend? If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all but one of them, what do you call it? If teachers taught, why didn’t preachers praught? If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat? In what language do people recite at a play and play at a recital? Ship by truck and send cargo by ship? Have noses that run and feet that smell? How can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same, while a wise man and a wise guy are opposites? You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your house can burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a form by filling it out and in which an alarm goes off by going on. English was invented by people, not computers, and it reflects the creativity of the human race (which, of course, isn’t a race at all).

True to my style they are random and jumbled. Take them as such and don’t inspect them for deeper meaning. I have been doing something or other with computers every since my mom gave up trying to understand them in 1983. Computers were more interresting than homework, so I spent my time on them rather than homework (totally worth it). Point is, I’ve been doing this for a while and have had the chance to observe quite a number of people in the field. I have seen genius and I have seen utter stupidity. And neither was tied in any meaningful way to gender. From my personal observations, I always thought that there is very little distinction in terms of gender and computers. But then i grew up on the tail end of a history of computing determined by women. Before my time even, computers were thought of as the domain of women. But I digress. Things have changed and today women in tech are, at least in the western world, a rarity. In recent years, we were off and on looking for people to add to our technical team. And it fell to me to find them. I did a lot of interviews, and the thing that actually surprised me was how many female applicants there were. From seeing how many women there are in tech, I would have expected around 10% when in actuality it’s closer to 50%. When you are actually looking to hire people, you are trying to figure out whether they are (or could be) any good at the job you want them for. For that you start by looking at the paper form. What is their experience like, how did they do in school, what did they write about for their thesis and so on. This is where I was in for surprise number two: women are generally better at this stuff then men. They take more courses, get better grades, and write more interesting papers. And this is when you start smelling rat. You have these people that on paper look like really good candidates: they did the studies, they have experience at the level you asked for, yet they write cover letters that suggest that they barely know how to handle a mouse. For contrast males generally did less course work, have less experience and write less interesting papers. They often lack key skills required for the job, but figure often quite upfront, that they can pick those up on the job. So you go on to interviews. You get boys that don’t know crap and are full of themselves beyond belief. And you get girls that know their stuff, that have brilliant insights yet they talk as if they are barely literate; they present themselves as if they were barely intelligent enough to tie their show-laces. Just to clarify, this is in a western democracy; these are people that have gone through school and university, but often have not had a real job yet. We are talking straight from our educational facilities. So these are women that, simply for lack of time, have not experienced a sexist workplace yet. Though as a society, we manage to discourage women enough so that by they time they graduate from university, they have little faith in themselves. In a few short years our society manages to remove any shred of self-confidence from girls. So you go through interviews and you decide that he difference between two candidates aside from their gender is that they have less self confidence, ask for less money, and have higher potential for the job. Sounds great, but in reality it’s a trap. The thing I came to realize is: Self-confidence is actually the single most important skill any candidate brings to the job. So it really doesn’t matter if you did more and better courses. It doesn’t matter if you are more brilliant and actually understand the issues better than your peers. It does not matter if you’d actually be awesome at the job. Unless you actually believe in yourself your education and your experience are utterly worthless And here is the reasoning: The way you improve your skillset is by doing things that are 90% stuff you have done a billion times and 10% stuff you have never done before. The same goes for humanity as a whole. So while it’s alright to ask for help and advice, there are 10% that you and potentially no one around has done before. To accomplish these 10% and therefore add value you have to do two things: Try to achieve them Believe that you can achieve them When I, or anyone else, gives someone a task it’s not because I want to see them fail at it. It’s because I genuinely believe they can complete that task. So if you doubt that you can complete a task that you have been given, you doubt not only your own ability, you also doubt the judgement of the person giving you the task. In the end Henry Ford was right when he said: Whether you think you can or you think you can’t you are correct. With every time you doubt yourself, your job performance slides up to the point that you are detracting value from the enterprise rather than addig value. And it’s not a matter of skill, smarts or know-how, it’s purely a matter of self confidence. So the frustrating thing is that there are all these people that have the smarts to be awesome in technology yet they insist on doubting themselves into uselessness. So if there is any advice I would give a young woman entering the work-place it is this: Believe in yourself or nobody else will. Believe in youself because you deserve to. Believing in yourself is the single most important skill you bring to any job."

A lot of boys and girls think their lives will have meaning if they find a partner who wants nothing else in life but them. That’s not healthy. That’s falling in love with the idea of a person, not the actual person."

What I am ponderous about right now, is some of the tumblrs I am following and their doubtful outlook on life. There are people doubting their self worth, people complaining about a shit year, and more negativity. And reality is, they are not perfect, and neither was the last year. But then I try to put things into perspective. We all have a roof over our heads, sufficient food and regular access to the internet. We live in more or less civilised and democratic countries that vouch-safe our personal safety. So actually for us, the year 2013 was comparatively awesome. But even if you don’t like the global comparison thing, there is something you need to realise. You exist, and you provide me with pleasure through your posts. And it is highly likely, that it’s not just me whose life you are improving. So even if the entire rest of your life were an abject failure, you would still be a valuable asset to this world. So rather than feel sorry for yourself, celebrate the passing of 2013 and get excited about the coming year. And do so in the knowledge that each and everyone of you is being appreciated. So thank you all for a fun year. Stay positive. No one I follow has a real reason to feel down about themselves."

Miley Cyrus does not care what you think about her haircut, Justin Bieber does not care what you think of his tattoos and Gwyneth Paltrow couldn’t care less regarding what you think about her diet. 2. Stop resenting yourself for drunk texting your ex. Sure, its a little embarrassing, but at least you’re addressing your feelings. Not that you should aim to drink an entire bottle of rum then see what happens, but… roll with the punches. 3. Leave the country. If you don’t have money, look into doing charity work abroad. Some programs will sponsor you. 4. If you hate your job, quit your job. Repeat after me: THE MONEY IS NOT WORTH IT. Food and shelter are clutch though, so make sure you have another job lined up. 5. Stop beating yourself up for skipping the gym on days you truly didn’t have time. But also, stop skipping the gym on days you had plenty of time to go. 6. Make up — not to be confused with make out — with an ex. 7. Rid yourself of enemies. Apologize for what you did wrong and forgive those who have wronged you. 8. Rid yourself of “frenemies.” Don’t spend 2014 surrounded by people you secretly despise. 9. If you think somebody is cute, say “hi” and introduce yourself. Every relationship you have ever had started with a greeting. 10. Leave your phone number for someone. Worst-case scenario: you won’t get a call and maybe you’ll feel a tiny bit embarrassed. Regardless of the outcome, you put yourself out there and probably made the other person’s day. 11. Stop caring about how many people “like” your Instagram photos. If you like the photo enough to post it, what else matters? Social media anxiety is a waste of time. 12. Cross something off your bucket list. Sky dive, bungee jump, scuba dive, etc. Don’t make excuses as to why you can’t accomplish something, and check out 13. Stop hating yourself for eating dessert. A piece of birthday cake is a right, not a privilege. 14. Keep a journal. It doesn’t have to be something you use daily, but documenting your experiences is incredibly important. You’ll appreciate it later. 15. Strengthen relationships with family members. Blood is thicker than water. 16. Help strangers. “Pay it forward,” do good things for the world — and don’t post a Facebook status about it. 17. Conquer a fear. Personally, I fear Bikram yoga. 18. Turn off your smartphone at dinner. 19. Don’t check your Twitter feed when you’re with friends. 20. Try a fashion trend you never thought you could pull off. And, do it with confidence. Floppy hats, snap backs, Harem pants; you can do it! 21. Double-text without fear. THOU SHALL NOT BE IGNORED! 22. Shop locally, eat locally and recognize where your money is going. Consumers control the economy, so visit the mom-and-pop coffee shop down the street instead of Starbucks. Shop at boutiques rather than chains (they aren’t all expensive — trust me). Try Etsy.com instead of retail conglomerates. 23. Cry. When you’re happy and when you’re sad; embrace your emotions as they come. 24. Stop being so shallow. Next time you find yourself judging someone based on his or her appearance, imagine the person standing in front of you saying, “I’m beautiful.” You’ll start to believe it. 25. If you want someone to commit to you, vocalize it. Don’t settle for being someone’s “f*ck buddy” if that isn’t what you want. “Together” is the waiting period between “talking” and “dating”; purgatory shouldn’t last forever."

Ever religion worth its salt needs to have at least two, better more, sects! To rectify this egregious oversighgt, I propose we divide pastafarians into two major camps: those that worship his holy noodliness by eating pasta the (self)righteous ones that call such behaviour blasphemous - they avoid anything that could even remotely be construed as pasta in their diet We could then avoid having viscious debates about pasta (dietary item vs. object of adoration) by grudgingly glaring at each other. Of course once we have sects, sectarian conflict is mandatory. And the really heavy hitters have shown that any religion in the upper league needs to have had a few religious wars. Considering the generally peaceful nature of pastafarians, I suggest we employ modern technology for the task. By utilising games like this we can be responsible for the senseless massacre of millions of (albeit virtual) people within days, rather than the months and years those others needed. So heed my call and let&rsquo;s take this thing to the next level. Pastafarians of the world divide!"

It was really totally awesome: we basically spent the weekend at a luxury hotel being pampered and visiting the sites. Only one thing managed to get under my skin that weekend. And I hadn’t realised how much it actually bothered me. While in Budapest I did a bit of lnstagraming as well as reading Tumblr. I mean there is very little better than having a drink and reading tumblrs in front of a fire. The one thing that would have made that better would have been if half of the blogs I follow hadn’t been censored on the hotel wifi for being pornography. Lest I be correctly accused of being a horny old man, let me clear something up. While l have viewed porn on occasion, l do not not follow pornographic tumblrs. What was identified as porn was: anything tagged as “food porn” anything containing parts of potentially human anatomy such as the recipe for spinach filled chicken breast and last but not least a rant by someone about UK legislation to filter porn at an ISP level Aside from the obviously bad implementation of this filter I have a problem with the fact that it seems some people think that this kind of thing is OK and should be done. Usually someone will then invoke the “poor vulnerable children” that have to be protected because they are with their negligent parents at a luxury hotel. Let me tell you something as the parent of tar vulnerable children: l would rather my children encounter porn on the net, which l would prevent to begin with, because l closely supervise my kids internet use, than have them encounter a censorship page and grow up in the belief that it is ok to restrict people’s access to information. History has taught us that freedom of speech, both passive and active, is the most important tool to protect society from oppression. While we usually only consider censorship in terms of state actors, it is important not to forget that states are not the only ones setting norms. If we accept today that it is OK for some company to censor network access, we start down the slippery slope towards accepting censorship in general. So this is not about whether that hotel had the right to filter the net access it provides, it’s about whether it should. Prudish groups have hotels believe that they are expected to filter any network access they provide. It is high time that they are told otherwise. After all how are they supposed to know that we expect them to stand up for freedom and not for some prudes idea of morality. To that end I have decided to write a letter to the hotel I was staying at and explain my view to them. Maybe I should also make up cards to put into rooms explaining that the hotel has decided not to filter network access and warning guests that they need to use their own judgment. Those I would send out to hotel chains all over the world. Whatever I decide to do exactly, it is high time to stop this creeping censorship before it gets out of hand."

If that is true, then any change, conscious or not to your bearing should alter the reaction of the world at large towards you. Generally people walk slightly bent forward with the shoulders hunched slightly forward as well. All in all we generally appear more like the bicyclist in the the red shirt than the obviously proud participant in the NYC gay pride parade. What if, I were to change the way I walk. Quite consciously mimicking a soldier on the parade ground, or for that matter the specimen in the fore-front of the photo above. This should then result directly in an altered reaction of the world toward me. Now I did this experiment, and I do have some interesting results. The difference is actually more pronounced than I&rsquo;d have ever thought. An upright posture automatically leads to a perceivable increase in perceived confidence. So simply by walking upright, people believe you are more confident. In addition, the altered reaction of your surroundings actually increases your own confidence. So you basically start a virtuous circle. Besides that I actually felt the strain in my back muscles for the first two days. After that it became much easier and my general posture improved a bit. I think I&rsquo;ll keep going."

Fascinating. I may have to rethink my alarm clock. Maybe I&rsquo;d be better of getting those &ldquo;daylight bulbs&rdquo; they use for green houses and putting a dimmer switch on a timer instead.

It could roll out a subscription service, akin to Amazon Prime, that would include perks like predictive transportation, so that, for example, when Uber sees an appointment on your Google calendar for a cross-town meeting, it sends a car to your office automatically at the right time … The result of Uber’s efforts, in other words, could be the creation of a techno-metropolis, in which people and goods are ferreted around seamlessly and, perhaps, automatically.

Now I like language, and I love languages. Which is why I speak two like a native and another two to a level that I can hold an intelligent conversation. Thing is, that&rsquo;s just for fun and they are all major languages. Truth be told from the perspective of benefit to the world, I don&rsquo;t think more that a handful of languages are a good thing. Diversity is not a good thing in itself, nor is it a bad thing. It&rsquo;s just a thing. There is this claim that language diversity is a cause for cultural diversity. Again, so what. There are a lot of things that are expressions of culture. And we certainly don&rsquo;t want to keep all of them around. Guillotines were an expression of culture, so were witch-hunts. Do we really want to insist that all diversity and all culture is a good thing? Everything has its time and its time to end. Maybe it&rsquo;s just the right time to let 7387 languages slip into oblivion."

		"title": "A bit ago I wrote a post about Ghost in which I made the claim that they had pretty much screwed it up. Of course this presumes that there is a common understanding of what that and &ldquo;doing it right&rdquo; means. I have been doing a lot of thinking about that for a while and have spoken to a few people (read non-tech, blog writers). By now I have come to some conclusions; too many to put into one post :). However a first stab at it would be a good thing. There are really two distinct facades to the issue: The features and capabilities The technical system and its design The first is really what and the second how. The what, according to the Ghost About Page is &ldquo;Just Blogging&rdquo;. And I take that quite literally. To me that means &ldquo;authoring blog posts&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s it. It means: No User-Management No Administration No Media-Management No built in visual frippery (read custom theme engine) Literally nothing that is not directly necessary for authoring posts In fact, there is such a system (almost). It&rsquo;s tumblr minus the social aspects. If you take tumblr and remove the like and follow features, that&rsquo;s pretty much it. Now if that is the yard-stick that I measure the meaning of &ldquo;simply blogging&rdquo; by then Ghost is close but no cigar. Here are the things Ghost does that are too much: User Management / Authentication Visual Frippery From a technical perspective, there are alos ways to build such a system, and ways to avoid. Wordpress is one of the &ldquo;ways to avoid&rdquo;. I am certain that the wordpress developers feel a lot of code-shame about a lot of parts of wordpress. The system was originally conceived of by a kid and for fun. Given those origins, wordpress is quite impressive, but years later as adults knowing wordpress you should be able to come up with a better system design. Wired wrote: Ghost aims to reboot blogging… Ghost made many of the same mistakes as wordpress. For one they looked at the problem from the perspective of wordpress and simply said: &ldquo;that but without the cruft&rdquo;. They obviously did not think of why is there all this cruft? Sometimes it&rsquo;s not a reboot, but a complete system reinstall you need. Let me take a stab at that why is there so much cruft: because the original software lacked a feature that would have prevented someone from using it. In consequence they added the feature. This happened too many times to count. At some point plugins were put conceived, but that just changed the question from &ldquo;do we put it in&rdquo; to &ldquo;do we put it into core or leave it as a plugin&rdquo;. In other words people needed a specific feature. Sounds pretty much the atithesis of what Ghost wants. Guess what though: wordpress started out as just blogging as well. It obviously failed at remaining that, and there is no reason to believe that Ghost will fare any better. So why not turn the question around? Ghost has explicitely decided that comments are not part of &ldquo;simple blogging&rdquo;. Luckily there are systems that do &ldquo;just commenting&rdquo; out there, so just integrate those. Why not do something similar for the core blogging part as well. Don&rsquo;t build a system that can take plugins, be a generic blogging plugin. What would this look like? Well just provide an API that can deal with blog related actions. It does nothing other that create, update, delete and fetch blog posts. When you start it you have to provide it with a method to access storage, and a method to request user information from a credential it was handed. It should also be attachable to some publish/subscribe messaging system, to notify other system parts that an action had taken place. That&rsquo;s it: no rendering posts, no lists, no commenting, no tags, just blogging. Then you have a second piece of software that subscribes to post events and provides an api for tagging. It automatically indexes new posts and provides an api to add and remove tags from a post as well as find posts that have a set of tags. That&rsquo;s it, nothing else. Then you have a service that listens to post and tag events, and does indexing for full text search. And you could have any number of these services and interconnect them as you want. But how do you read that blog you may ask. Well that really depends. You could have a highly complex website, where the blog post is simply a piece of the whole. That backend could then fetch the article from the Blog-API and render it any way the site wants. You could not publish it on your own at all, but instead submit it to other blogs/micro-blogs. You could simply provide an RSS-Feed. You could be using it as a nicer interface to wordpress for all the software cares. The point is, that the actual display functionality is just another part of interconnected entities. And now you have also built something that will scale. Since you have systems that are not tightly coupled, but can be on may different machines, you can scale horizontally very easily. SQLite is no longer sufficient for your storage needs, simply point your blogging piece at Amazon-S3. you have too many people readin your stuff (as if that was possible), host your site ona. cloud service and attach multiple API servers at the back. You gain total flexibility to do anything you need and it will remain about &ldquo;just blogging&rdquo; There are a lot more thoughts and a lot more details that did not make it into this post, but I hope it is sufficient to capture where I think things should be heading. It&rsquo;s also a start on explaining why I think Ghost is not the way forward. As much as I love the editing UI. I just think bloggig does not need a reboot, it needs a completely fresh start."

Yet the methods used are largely arbitrary. This goes for hacktivism as well as copyright infringement. As this is at the root of U.S. justice, it might be worth to campaign for higher standards there. One possibility could be to require proven damage and cause, so whoever claims that a damage occurred has the burden of proof in terms of both the amount of damage as well as the cause. The U.S. justice system seems to be totally out of step with the rest of the world. It is slowly but surely getting more and more stringent. It is in fact going from a measured and fair system of justice to something quite different. The U.S. are now no longer in line with what the western world conceives of as fairness and justice, but rather with what the Chinese and arab worlds think of as justice. Now this might be because the rest of the western states have gotten weak and ineffectual, but it might well also be that there is a serious moral regression in progress in the U.S. "

Because of this it pains me when a truly horrible iPhone user experience comes my way where i have to ask myself: &ldquo;How did this ever get pas QA?&rdquo; In iOS there is this neat feature called &ldquo;Do Not Disturb&rdquo;. I love it and it makes life so much nicer. It basically turns of all those bleeps and bluprs off, so that you are not disturbed. The main use I make of it is that I don&rsquo;t want messages that arrive while I sleep to wake me. So for this reason i set it to automatically turn on at night. Usually I&rsquo;m pretty regular in my sleep pattern. I am likely to be in bed by midnight and seldom have to get up before 6:45 in the morning. So i set my iPhone to turn this feature on from 11 o'clock at night until half past 6 in the morning. It works like a charm, set and forget and you will have quiet during the night. It works too well in fact. Because what happened to me recently is that I set my iPhone alarm explicitly to ring at 6:20 in the morning, because I had to for once to get up early. I figured I explicitly set an alarm, it always wakes me up during the week, why would I not rely on it for this? Well you can probably already guess what happened: I woke up on my own at 8:45 in the morning, way too late to salvage anything. I was yelling at myself, how could I have overheard the alarm? Easy actually. I overheard it because it did not in fact ring. Whoever thought that &ldquo;Do Not Disturb&rdquo; applies to a utility that you have to explicitly set; a utility that has no other purpose than to in fact disturb you; a utility that is so clearly out of the scope of the &ldquo;Do Not Disturb&rdquo; feature? I mean I could even understand it if you had turned on &ldquo;Do not Disturb&rdquo; manually, but if it&rsquo;s been activated automatically? How did this ever get past QA. I am sorely disappointed, but it did teach me a valuable lesson: do not rely on modern technology for anything important. Since then I have dug out my ancient wind-up alarm-clock that my grandfather gave to me when I was four. I set it eery night now and let it tick-tock me off to sleep. I still also set my iPhone, but it has lost the trust i had placed in it. It will have to work hard to earn back that trust."

		"title": "Over the years, I have often heard/read the same question, or type of question: Should I use X or Y for my web app scale. X and Y are of course nifty databases, or framework thingamagics or the like. And then there would inevitably be two camps arguing the pros and cons and an original questioner none the wiser. After being in this space for decades (yes I was doing this before the first .com bubble) I learned something important, that I want to share today: Technology doesn&rsquo;t matter!!! Yes you read correctly, me the tech guy is saying technology doesn&rsquo;t matter. Oh and yes I am serious. The thing is, most of the tech stuff we love and hate and argue about, will be just fine for all our small little projects with less that 1e6 page views a month. You simply don&rsquo;t have to worry about scaling either up or out. Even if your trafic suddenly spikes and goes off and doubles you are then serving 2e6 views, which is pretty much the same order of magnitufe and shouldn&rsquo;t relly stress you too much. Heck even if you grow an order of magnitude or two, facebook has proven to us all, that even then you can get that done with php &amp; mysql, which is pretty much the least scalable and least performing starting point out there. So if it&rsquo;s not the actual technology that you choose that is relevant, what enables you to grow at web scale and still not break out a sweat? It&rsquo;s a modus operandi thing. It&rsquo;s a how you do things in a way that allows you maximum flexibility. Loose couple or always use abstract wrappers The biggest problem you can have is that you have painted yourself into a corner. Imagine you have chosen a database technology, because it was the hot thing at the time. Now a year or 2 later the people developing your database of choice have moved on and it turned out to be not so hot after all (think couchdb for an example of both). If you bet the farm on that database and have coupled it tightly with your entire site, you have just lost the farm, or won an unlimited supply of unpaid overtime. How do you avoid that? Simple, treat every technology choice as replacable. Never utilize an actual API provided by a technology in your core product. Always encapsulate. If you do and you have abstracted away the technology you are using away from your app, it becomes rather simple to exchange one piece of tech for another. Couch is not working out? Change a couple of lines in one place and use Mongo or Redis or any of the others. Don&rsquo;t optimize it slows you down The second big issue that can arise is that you want to have everything nice and fast and spend an inordinate amount of time optimizing your code. Well guess what, you are wasting time and introducing complexity which is likekly to cause bugs. I can&rsquo;t recall how often optimizations I did caused bugs in edge cases. Well the edge turns out to be where it&rsquo;s at and edge cases turn out to be quite common. So when you calculate how long you spend optimizing code and then fixing all the bugs the optimization introduced that&rsquo;s the cost. Now if you look at the benefit of optimizing, it will likely be a bit of speed or more linear scaling behaviour. At this time it&rsquo;s time to start thinking of whether there are other ways of gaining these benefits. Usually the answer is &ldquo;yes, just add more computing power&rdquo;. Guess what your time is expensive; computing power is cheap. So rather than optimize, buy some more computing power. There are very few cases in web app development where optimizing is actually worth while, presuming you are not being deliberately stupid in your algorithms to begin with. Architect in a way that you can solve your problem by throwing money at it I want to close with this gem from a talk by Yashwatnt Nelapati and Marty Weiner. If you write your stuff in a way you can solve scaling by deploying more of the same you&rsquo;ll be good. Node with its single threaded approach stears you into the right direction to begin with."

Finally something a bit more sensible to replace Wordpress. And then Ghost was released. I had a long look at it and did a code-review, and in the end I have to say it&rsquo;s dead on arrival, or at least I hope it will be. The idea of doing a simple &ldquo;just blogging&rdquo; platform is great, and the UI thoughts are great as well, but the actual implementation is horrific. Yes they abandoned PHP in favour of NodeJS to gain some hype, and good on them. But they basically took all the mistakes that were made implementing Wordpress and reimplemented them using NodeJS. They built a monolith that pretends to be modular, without actually understanding what modular means. shudder They mixed concerns like crazy, made it pretty much impossible to embed it into something larger, and on and on. Every architectural mistake made by Wordpress has been repeated. And in return you don&rsquo;t event get the one single redeeming feature of Wordpress: its eco-system. The thing I fear though is that it will be successful. Because if this thing actually takes of, it will be the replacement for Wordpress and therefore disincentivise the creation of alternatives an thereby prolong the suffering. If it dies a quiet death, chances improve that something decent may actually be built to replace Wordpress, &lsquo;cause Ghost ain&rsquo;t it. P.S.: I normally don&rsquo;t like writing such negative posts about other people&rsquo;s hard work, but this just makes me sad. I guess with great hope comes great disappointment."

And it would have a random note generator that would be based on a percentage, so that the root note would be a higher percentage of going off, then the third, then the fifth. And during rush hour in the bigger stations, it would hopefully make a really beautiful piece of music. Each line would be a piece. The green line would go through different chords and when they intersected with other lines that would change that station."

This is great, since it enables a lot of interactivity on the net. It is actually designed in a way that allows for the service requesting access to specify what access it wants. Except it does not give the user any choice in what rights to grant. Take the example of Disqus. If you log in via Twitter, Disqus asks for the right to access your account information as well as tweet on your behalf. And that&rsquo;s where the trouble starts. I have no issue with handing over my information that Twitter has to Disqus, but under no circumstances do I ever want Disqus to tweet on my behalf. There is simply no reason it ever should. And truth be told, Disqus has so many silly or stupid idio(t)syncrasies that it is not really a trustworthy service. Not that I think they are malicious, I just don&rsquo;t trust their sense of right and wrong to steer them right. (Any case: stop the rathole) What would be needed is twitter still going through with the OAuth process, yet present the user with the option to disable some of the permissions. After all, even simply going through with the process gives value: authentication. Except that this is in direct contradiction of the specification. So I guess we really need OAuth2.1 which would allow for this. After all, I trust a lot of services somewhat, but not with everything they ask for. Especially when they behave like little children. I have to tell my little ones that they can&rsquo;t have everything they ask for all the time. Why won&rsquo;t you let me tell some web sites the same? P.S.: While I agree with what Eran Hammer said at RealTimeConf 2012 OAuth is the de-facto standard used by everyone. Yes it&rsquo;s bad, but it exists."

		"title": "I had a conversation last night with one of those coffee-script loving developers and I once again stated that I really dislike coffee-script. Contrary to previous exchanges of this nature this person did something unusual and smart for the breed: he asked WHY? I laid out some arguments for him and figured I have never done so in a coherent pattern before. So here it goes, the why to my dislike of coffee-script. Whenever you develop a more complex system than a hello world example, you layer a bunch of things on top of each other, use an oodle of modules and paradigms and glue them all together in hopes that they don&rsquo;t fall apart. You try to help make sure that they don&rsquo;t by adding tests and using more stuff for that. Simply put: Complex systems are complex This observation seems like a no-brainer and absolutely obvious. It is so obvious, that smart people tend to assume it and forget it. But it really does bear mentioning. The reason it is important is because complex things are hard to understand by their very nature. The more complex something is the harder it is to understand. Before I continue, we need to agree on the idea that: Hard to understand is an undesired property of software If you disagree here, the rest of the argument will not make sense to you. (You should also probably consider a change of career :( yikes). The fact that as complexity increases ease of understanding decreases means that we should strive to make our systems as complex as necessary yet as simple as possible. This philosophy is nothing new and nothing I came up with. If you you followed me to this point, the conclusion should not be a surprise: Since anything that adds complexity to the system is detrimental to its understandability, anything added must provide some significant benefit Not having been surprised, you will likely be asking the same question I have asked when looking as coffee-script: &ldquo;What significant benefit does coffee-script provide that justifies its addition to the stack?&rdquo; CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way That is the claim that the coffee-script site makes. That means that coffee-script by its very definition of itself is simply syntactic sugar on top of javascript. Syntactic sugar that requires the addition of a compiler to the tool-chain, that has a non-intuitive syntax for someone used to the curly bracket family and that does not eliminate the need to know and be fully conversant in javascript. Looking at what it costs and what it gives, coffee-script is extremely expensive. It adds a large amount of overhead, it significantly reduces the number of people that feel comfortable understanding your project and it provides very little benefit all in the form of syntactic sugar. After this analysis of why i don&rsquo;t like to employ coffee-script myself it might be worth exploring why I believe module creators should not use it either. If you write your module in coffee-script you add the complexity of coffee-script to the complexity of your own module without providing the user with additional benefits. And that is already the best case scenario where the user is willing to engage your module. The other option the user of your module has is to effectively treat it as closed-source, because coffee-script has to be treated as immutable if you are not willing to write coffee-script. While it you might be able to modify the compiled/generated javascript, your changes will never go upstream, because there it&rsquo;s coffee-script. So for all intents and purposes you are writing closed-source software (or at least almost). So there simply isn&rsquo;t a rationale to adding coffee-script to your stack if you are writing non-trivial code. In fact coffee-script is detrimental to your code "

		"title": "With the surveillance of the world by the NSA being played up and down the media, it is easy to forget why it is a problem to begin with. It&rsquo;s easy to argue that the NSA actually should do what it&rsquo;s doing, after all they are fighting terrorists and criminals, and these arguments are dangerously alluring. Surveillance by jonathan mcintosh, on Flickr We want to feel safe, surveillance by the state needs its limits. It needs them not just for those that have nothing to hide, but also to those that do. While we general want to have our populace to obey the agreed upon laws and conventions, social evolution happens because people challenged the established borders and laws in our society. This is not some abstract thought experiment, this is something that we were able to observe within living memory. Imagine for a minute the world of 1955. Rosa Parks - Image Source: Wikipedia If Rosa Parks had been constantly surveilled, the civil rights movement might not have ever gotten of the ground. What if the NSA, that had just been founded 3 years before, had ignored it&rsquo;s mandate limit and listened in on every meeting of Martin Luther King. While the breaking of laws in general is something societies frown upon, it&rsquo;s the breaking and bending of established norms that is the universal cause of progress. If our surveillance becomes so tight as to basically eliminate all law breaking, we eliminate progress. If that were all, then we could put it off for the future. After all even with the NSA programs that have become public and the ones that likely exists and have not become known yet we are quite a bit of from total surveillance yet. The problem though is that even before the system has become perfect, it throws its shadows. It&rsquo;s about self-censorship. If you have to fear that the government is listening to you and have to fear consequences from what you say, you will automatically restrict what you say. Whether the state actually assigns consequences or not is actually immaterial. The potential for consequences due to the existence of government surveillance is a sufficient motivator for self-censorship. A prime example for this in another context can be found in the book publishing industry of modern day China. A recent New York Times article on the subject contains the following quote by the editor in chief of a prominent publishing house in Beijing: &ldquo;Self-censorship has become the most effective weapon&rdquo;New York Times: Authors Accept Censors’ Rules to Sell in China Stopping social progress is a problem for any imperfect society. We can all agree that the United States, while better than many/most, has not yet attained perfection. Until it has government surveillance is a problem. I speak of the United States because it&rsquo;s a country whose issues touch the entire world and anyone on the planet will be aware of the media coverage of the US surveillance programs as well as the countries history. The same principal applies to any society. To believe that there is a country on the planet that is capable of observing its citizens that is currently refraining is akin to believing in the easter bunny. Of course GCHQ (Great Britain), the BND (Germany) and many others are doing the same thing. This is a globalised world and this is a global issue. So it&rsquo;s not just that the NSA is a danger to the USA, government surveillance is a danger to the western world."

		"title": " Yahoo! by eric hayes, on Flickr About a month ago I wrote my first post here entitled Giving Yahoo! another shot. Now it&rsquo;s time to look back over the last month and record an update of how it went. TL;DR I&rsquo;m both impressed and disappointed. It&rsquo;s a love/hate relationship, but the love outweighs the hate by at least 2:1 Yahoo! Mail Let&rsquo;s start with Yahoo! mail. I have to say I&rsquo;m impressed by the new UI. It&rsquo;s gorgeous and functional at the same time. I am not quite certain why yet, but in terms of actually working for me, I like it much better than GMail. It comes across more intuitive. Migrating all my existing mail into Yahoo! mail was a bit painful, because it seems that Yahoo! rate limits the IMAP connection. That&rsquo;s a sensible thing to do and will not be a problem during normal operations, but when you use IMAP to pump in close to 20000 e-mails it is, but one that is easily solved. The operation of an inbox with 20000 emails on the other hand is like &ldquo;No Sweat, this is Yahoo! and we do scale&rdquo; easy. Their way to handle spam, is among the best I have seen. So all in all an awesome experience. Which brings me to the hate part. I liked the experience, so I wanted to attach my own domain, which also host email for my family. Yahoo! offers a pay-for-play product for this. However that is just hostile to configure. First off it requires that you use Yahoo! DNS-Servers for your domain, rather than just setting MX records. I won&rsquo;t go into all the details; suffice it to say: &lsquo;Yahoo! Mail for a family is not really a viable option&rsquo; Never the less, I will definitely use Yahoo! mail for myself. I&rsquo;ll forward all mails to it and have set it up to be able to send from all my addresses. The setup is actually pretty sweet. The hate portion of this is basically that the whole personal domain stuff is a bit messy and that the Yahoo! implementation of IMAP seems to be a bit wonky (according to Yahoo! themselves). Those are not an issue if it&rsquo;s just yourself using it. But once you are getting amateurs (read your company or your family) involved that makes it a no-go. Flickr Flickr is awesome, and is definitely back in my repertoire. Very nice, very easy. If only it were simpler to search. I often search for CC-Licensed stuff to use here, and every time I have to search by keyword then go into the advanced search scroll down select the licensing stuff and search again. Flickr could be such a great share image resource if only … Well, I&rsquo;ll be putting CC-Licenses on most of my pictures and maybe someday … Tumblr Another awesome acquisition. I have tried the whole blogging thing before; checked out Wordpress, SquareSpace, Bloggr, and just about everything else. The Tumblr concept of simple easy posts where the default is short and sweet but you can go full out like this one makes it just right for me. There is actually a fair chance that I&rsquo;ll be much more prolific a writer than ever in the past. My Yahoo! Has become my default place I go first thing in the morning to catch up with what is going on in the world. I set it up with a mixture of my personal interests, world events and gossip and it provides me with the perfect information start to my day. I have to say though that the default setup I encountered was pretty good already. So personal adjustments aren&rsquo;t really all that necessary. Yahoo! Groups Simple, intuitive, full featured group organisation. I am in the process of migrating the mailing list for my kids classes to Yahoo! groups to enhance the parental interaction. Aside from that I&rsquo;m trying to get a regular NodeJS meetup in Vienna of the ground. Groups will definitely be at the core of organising all off that. Inspiration So far I like what I am experiencing with Yahoo! very much. It truly is a very compelling experience, much more so than I have experienced with Google. Google has obvious advantages, Apps and Search being just the most prominent, but wherever Yahoo! has comparable products, Yahoo! provides the nicer and kinder version. iGoogle is shutting down, no wonder it can&rsquo;t even compare to My Yahoo!. Google Groups vs. Yahoo! Groups is the difference between these two: both provide access to the ocean, but which one would you rather immerse yourself in. I guess Yahoo! is less automaton and simply friendlier. And that appeals to me. All of this has inspired me to actually engage more. The last couple of years, I have looked at the web as a tool or set of tools: mechanical, practical, sterile, artificially funny (think I&rsquo;m feeling lucky). Yahoo! has inspired me to give the web another shot at being a fun place to hang. That inspiration has led to me getting my digital life back in order. For the first time in … well forever, I actually have a consistent online identity. For the first time in just as long, I actually have secured my accounts in a meaningful way (i.e.: maybe not use the same password across the entire net ;) ). So as a resume of the first month of giving Yahoo! another shot, I have to say it&rsquo;s been worth it. I&rsquo;ll post another update on how things are a bit down the road, yet if things hold as they are, this might be among the best things to happen to my online life in a while."

Fundamentally governments are established for the purpose of facilitating the interactions between individuals and groups. This entails providing for communal services, defence toward external threats and regulating the interactions between citizens. In the three examples that triggered this line of thought, the institutions are refusing to provide the fundamental things they were created for adequately. Thankfully people generally agree that: Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes. The question is when governmental failings cease to be light and transient. They are becoming more severe an permanent every year."

There are problems with either and the debate around distributed teams is finally getting to a point where it gets from fanboyism to an actual intellectual debate. Team meeting by teemus, on Flickr My experience with distributed teams has been great. When you have all members of a team working from different locations and interacting exclusively online things work really well. There is one big caveat however; the moment there is a location that routinely contains more than one person, the team falls apart. So the real problem with distributed teams in my view is that it&rsquo;s an all or nothing proposal. Either you go all in or you leave it be. Workshifting: Bruno, Software Engineer by citrixonline, on Flickr Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean that localised teams are the answer to efficient work. Localised teams have the problem that all this direct interaction causes a lot of distraction, a lot of interruption. I have found that if you have room of developers working on a project they tend to be less efficient because of these interruptions. The model that I have come to believe is optimal is to have a fully distributed team, that travels to a common location every few months. This picks up some of the advantages of localised teams while keeping the advantages of distributed teams."

He makes the case, not least with his title &ldquo;first they came for the mugshot websites, but I said nothing&rdquo; that this decision to actively discourage a set of sites is a slippery slope. The danger is that we will not know what will be hidden from us by google next. Google chooses what we see and don’t see He contrasts the fiction of &ldquo;the right to be forgotten&rdquo; that the EU is currently pushing, which would give the end user a choice in what will be remembered, versus Google deciding what will be forgotten by virtue of not being found. While I find the EU position to be an unrealistic fiction, I find this Google action to be a worrisome precedent. It is of course legitimate for Google, and that&rsquo;s likely the argument they will put forth, to optimise for deducing the intent of the searcher and giving the best possible results. That is a specious argument though, because whether mugshot sites fit that intent depends on an assumption about intent that is decided on by google. Ultimately, it&rsquo;s a decision that is made. The real issue is that the market cannot possibly have a chance to compensate. Usually, one would make the claim that since the filtering is beong done by a corporation and not a state entity, the market has a chance to correct any problems. This however assumes that consumers have an opportunity to notice. In the case of filtering the web consumers will never know precisely because they will not know what they are missing. Mathew&rsquo;s worry about what Google will filter next is very valid. When it starts filtering things like Wiki-Leaks, or Snowden&rsquo;s revelations, that would be a real problem. Especially since we will not know what we did not find and we won&rsquo;t even know whether Google is filtering due to ideology or due to pressure from one or more states."

Especially because this cartoon about these conversations (thanks @izs for tweet) does have some truth to it. However, I feel that there is a point that is being missed. We are all human beings first. If we create an environment where another human being feels unwelcome or uncomfortable, or worse threatened, that is a problem. For this to be a problem it does not matter one bit whether that person be female, male, cis-, trans- or whichever label you want to apply. It matters solely that a potential member of our community does not feel welcome. One consequence of having created such an environment is the sprouting of sub-groups reserved for the sub-members that carry some sub-label or other. And that in turn is the official certificate of community failure. So while having a girls night out with your node friends might be a valuable experience for a female noder (just as a stereotypical example), it should definitely not become a thing simply because it means that the node community has failed so badly that it has to be separated along more or less arbitrary gender lines. To me that&rsquo;s not not about discrimination against men or any such non-sense. It&rsquo;s about failing to provide a community where people are respected for who they are and what they bring to the table. So rather than advocating Non-Binary-Node groups we should be working diligently on making our community one that does not need those sub-groups. So if Max Ogden&rsquo;s female friend is learning ruby rather than node because ruby has all these &ldquo;women in ruby&rdquo; groups, we should make the the effort of telling people, that they should learn node, because we have all those &ldquo;humans in node&rdquo; groups. Because that is truly being better rather than &ldquo;no worse than usual&rdquo;."

What they don’t mention is that the main character represents an increasingly common theme in American religion: The spiritual “none of the above.” TL;DR - screwy methods produce good headlines This article refers a lot to statistics and percentages. There are a few things to keep in mind though. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust any statistics that I did not fudge myself&rdquo; is a truism The results of statistics depend heavily on how the questions are asked. The current default, especially in the US, is religiosity on an almost fanatical level. The &ldquo;nones&rdquo; are considered the exception. To be religious is considered the norm. From such a starting point, it is very, VERY hard to actually come up with questions that do not influence the results towards religiosity. You can massage data into anyone believing anything if you just ask often enough in different ways. Combine that with an article author that writes mainly for regligionnews.com and you have a predictably skewed outcome. This is not due to maliciousness, bias or ineptitude of the author or the statisticians! It is rather because the methods and tools employed are skewed by the presumption of what social norms are. P.S.: I haven&rsquo;t seen it yet and this article has not managed to turn me off it yet. It&rsquo;s on my to-view-list."

He describes his idea quite eloquently and invites everyone to have a discussion about it; to prod and poke at it; to test it for soundness. While I find the idea quite brilliant, I do have a couple of issues, that make it a no go for me in terms of becoming the future standard for web-authentication: URL-Specificity: requiring the thing to use https:// or http:// or whatever is not a good idea. Who knows what protocol we will all be using a couple of years from now. SQRL should be possible over carrier pigeon Algorithm-Specificity: requiring the thing to use ed25519 is silly. It&rsquo;s not ubiquitous enough, to make it easy for websites to implement, nor can we be sure that it will remain strong long enough. The algorithm needs to be negotiable for this to become standard. QR-Codes: are already an outdated technology. It might be ok as one way to represent the URL to be encrypted right now, but it will be obsolete before it has even gained adoption. This is sad, because the fundamental idea is very good: have a site present a nonce and a URL where to send authentication derive from that and a master-key a site unique private/public key-pair sign the nonce and the URL and send the result with the public key to the endpoint specified the public key is the unique identifier of the user All of that is sound. Even the suggested user experience is good, especially when combined with a browser plugin as suggested in Security Now: 424. What is definitely not sound is the description of the protocol. I have to note though that it&rsquo;s early days yet. Not just is the current state not a full suggestion of a protocol, it&rsquo;s not even a fully fleshed out idea yet, which you can see by the plethora of missing/to-be-done pages on grc.com. So for now, it&rsquo;s kudos to @sggrc, let&rsquo;s work on getting this thing specified and fleshed out. It&rsquo;s important to make sure this get&rsquo;s done well, after all we don&rsquo;t want to create an incompatibility nightmare here."

It&rsquo;s a bad idea in terms of security. What annoys me about the whole biometrics conversation though is that it pretty much misses the point completely. What is happening in the discussion is that on the one hand you have the biometrics industry, pushing biometrics as a solution for all kinds of security problems, and on the other hand security experts, and other smart people like Dustin, dispute that biometrics are inherently insecure. The core problem though is that security is a matter of definition. Let&rsquo;s think about security in terms of the physical world. How do we secure our homes. We have locks, that can easily be picked; windows that shatter at the toss of a stone; doors that will not resist the boot of a determined intruder. And yet we are satisfied with the security provided by these measures. Thinking now in terms of IT systems, especially phones; Fingerprints are obviously insufficient security for the proverbial nuclear launch-codes. But then so are dinky locks insufficient for Fort-Knox. Are fingerprints sufficient for my smartphone though? Well that kind of depends on the information stored in there. For most of it, a fingerprint is enough. Just like a regular door and lock are sufficient for most parts of my house. But then there are small pieces of information, that may need to be on my phone secured by additional means, just like I have a safe at my house to better protect especially valuable items. You see, it really is a matter of degrees. For the most part, securing a phone, or laptop with a fingerprint is ok; it&rsquo;s a sufficient deterrent to the casual intruder. And then there are pieces of data, that are a bit more sensitive. Those I&rsquo;ll have to protect in addition to the regular access control. Passwords might be a good choice for a lot of that. However passwords aren&rsquo;t all that great a solution either. They really are too weak for real security. If the proverbial nuclear launch-codes were protected with a simple password system, I&rsquo;d be really scared. Nope, they are protected by multi-factor systems. For really sensitive data, that is a must. So security really is a matter of degrees; a matter of what needs to be secured and against what threats. And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so annoyed at the simplistic conversation going on about biometrics in security. To really provide us with good security, we will need to think about security much more in detail."

So they decided that shutting down the entire US federal government (with a very few exceptions) was a good idea. One of the things that did shut down, was national parks. And that’s where my understanding really stops. Why shutdown a park. It has been around long before humans, it doesn’t really need running! Forcing people out and blocking the area off is just silly. First off, blocking the park actually costs money. Simply sending federal employees home would have been much cheaper. Second, what the heck are they “shutting down”? the gift store? - who cares! the trees? - how? why? the rocks? - how? why? the rivers? - how? why? the animals? - how? why? I don’t think any other country on the planet would even contemplate “shutting down a national park”. Maybe shuttering the ranger station and the gift shop for a couple of days, but this? It all started out as a couple of House Republicans showing of that they aren’t the brightest people in the world. It ended up demonstrating, that maybe those representatives are still a lot smarter than the park service."

The LA-Times reported that LAUSD halts home use of iPads for students, which might just be the silliest thing to it could do. The one thing sillier is to truly believe that it could prevent this to begin with. But aside from all that, there is a much deeper question that should be raised. That is not &ldquo;can we prevent students from surfing the net&rdquo;, but &ldquo;should we prevent students from surfing the net&rdquo;. As has been previously discussed in what inner city kids know about social media kids don&rsquo;t really need to be protected from the internet by people that know less about it than they do. We (and the LAUSD) should be proud that students circumvented the stupid restrictions so quickly and commend them for it. They should also not restrict students use of the tools that they were given. The LAUSD should be embarrassed by all of this. Not that their security measures where circumvented, but rather that they thought they were warranted and their reaction to the circumvention. Maybe the people at the LAUSD should be sent back to school; obviously they are not yet ready for the 21st century."

The article by Rebecca Rosen presents a study about the availability of copyrighted works from different decades. According to the article the study comes to the conclusion, that copyright law causes books that are still under copyright protection to be more likely to be out of print than those in the public domain. The conclusion from that is that copyright owners are not in fact monetizing the works they own, but rather let them fade into obscurity my not making them available. So while there is no profit from them being made, society is also loosing out on them because intellectual substance is locked away. Here is to hope that we can reverse at least some of the current state of IP-Stupidity by using studies like this. After all, this basically proves that the current copyright law achieves the opposite of what was intended when the original copyright laws were passed. Maybe we need to do the same thing for patents. After all, many have realised that the current patent regime harms innovation rather than fuelling it. If we could actually scientifically prove this realisation, maybe we have a chance of making some changes there as well."

The CCC did a pretty good job explaining their aim: &ldquo;We hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics. It is plain stupid to use something that you can´t change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token&rdquo;, said Frank Rieger, spokesperson of the CCC. &ldquo;The public should no longer be fooled by the biometrics industry with false security claims.&rdquo; But then they go of the deep end and talk about biometric passports? That&rsquo;s basically just ideological fluff that, while potentially valid, demeans the good statement they were making: Do not believe that a fingerprint is the ultimate in security. It&rsquo;s more like the child-proofing of a medicine bottle: it works against children and is useless against (most) adults. The fingerprint scanner on the iPhone is the same thing. It keeps people without a lot of motivation out. For those with the know-how and the motivation there is a system to deal with it. It&rsquo;s called remote wipe. And if even that is insufficient then you should probably not have your data on you phone. The thing to realise is that security is not an absolute and it&rsquo;s not about a technology or a product. Security means different things for different situations. It&rsquo;s about a use case and the risks associated with that use-case. We have to question what we want to achieve. It&rsquo;s definitely not preventing determined criminals from accessing our phone data. It&rsquo;s to prevent easy access to that data when we leave our phone on our desk when we step away. So when you think about security, you need to think about what it is you need/want; you need to look at your use-case. Media-Outlets reporting the story: The Register NY-Mag Forbes Stupid Analogy I love to come up with analogies. Often they turn out stupid. This is one of those. However they usually do contain a grain of truth and when pondered might actually lead to good insights. I&rsquo;ll leave this one here in case someone wants to go down a rat-hole for a while Take contracts as an example. We put squiggly lines on pieces of paper and call it a signature. We accept that as proof of intent to form a contract. And guess what it works most of the time and it&rsquo;s totally insecure. If someone with sufficient motivation wants to do so, he can just put different squiggly lines on the paper than he usually and then claim he never signed after reaping the benefits of the contract. That&rsquo;s what we call fraud and we made laws against that. Thing is, it works well enough for 99.9% of all cases. And for the few cases it doesn&rsquo;t, we have a system in place to handle it. "

After the talk while watching a bunch of nodecopters crash, I got to talking with Adam about security bugs in modules and the fact that he seems to me to be an incorrigible optimist thinking he can actually make things safe. You know the way people talk when they have a beer/cider in hand it it ain&rsquo;t the first night out ;) Well Adam made a comment, that I should write a blog-post about it. I said that I&rsquo;m not really into blogging. Well I&rsquo;m not, but I try and try again. So this endeavour on tumblr is actually Adam&rsquo;s fault. So here goes nothing. The Problem with Express/bodyParser was discussed heatedly up and down twitter. (If you missed it, be happy) I have a problem with the statements made in the article, because it misses the most important point. He writes a short piece of code, and then claims that it&rsquo;s dangerous. And he is right however, I can do the very same thing with any API. while (42) setInterval(console.log.bind(console, 'Hallo'), 1) is pretty dangerous as well. (Go try it in your node-REPL and come back when you killed it ;) ) The point here is that any API, can be dangerous if you don&rsquo;t know what you are doing. If you don&rsquo;t think about what the module you want to use actually does, and don&rsquo;t think about what you are doing, then well you are never going to write anything that is even remotely secure. Of course Andrew realises this and he says: You can prevent this attack by always checking whether req.files is present for endpoints in which you use bodyParser or multipart, and then deleting the temp files. Note that this is every POST endpoint if you did something like app.use(express.bodyParser()). Which makes it even sadder that he chose the title he did, because it is hyperbole and doesn&rsquo;t add to the security conversation. What we should be thinking about is how we can get people to educate themselves about what they are doing. Which is why I love what Adam is doing at the Node-Security Project. This will be a great boon to the NodeJS community."

I will write down here every once in a while how the experience goes, but so far i like it. Yahoo-Mail is a much better fit for how i use E-Mail than GMail ever was.
