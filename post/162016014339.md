            ***Question: *** As an atheist introvert who did youth groups and was even an altar server of the Roman Catholic variety... I can sympathize SO. HARD.

            ***Answer: *** I WAS ALSO AN ALTAR SERVER.

Until I almost killed the bishop.Then, for some reason, they didn’t let me serve anymore…
