<p>If you decide to block the only thoroughfare at a train station and a kid falls over your luggage it&rsquo;s a pretty dumb move to get in the kids face, especially if just behind the kid is it&rsquo;s father that&rsquo;s about double your size.</p>

<p>When you the get told to chill by your girl friend as well as the father of said kid, it&rsquo;s never smart to throw a punch at said father.</p>

<p>If said father then decides not to engage in fisticuffs, but rather simply knees you in the balls and leaves it&rsquo;s pretty silly to swear at your (ex?)girlfriend when she is leaving you there.</p>

<p>Here us some free advice:</p>

<ol><li>Don&rsquo;t be an inconsiderate asshat</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t have a go at kids</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t pick a fight you are going to loose</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t swear at your girl</li>
</ol><p>These are just some basics, once you grasp those, there is a whole advanced class in being a man as well.</p>

<p>(P.S.: No I was not the dad in question, though I did empathize with him)</p>
