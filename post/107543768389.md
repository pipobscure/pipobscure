title: Dear Tumblr users who I don&rsquo;t know in real life, I really like seeing your personal posts, even the whiny angsty ones, and particularly the strange boring ones. I like these little windows into your lives even if I&rsquo;ve never seen pictures of you and all I really know is that we like a few of the same tv shows. Please continue to let me read your to do lists and your conversations with strange relatives. Thank you, Stranger from the internet.
