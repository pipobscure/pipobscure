 * [my friend is going to this guys house tonight. He's like 21 and she's 16 but she told him she was 19. Her parents think she's staying at one of our other friends house. I'm worried about her because she met him like 1 time before now and she just sent me a picture of a bottle of vodka that she's taking with her. I tried to tell her to be careful but she's so naive that it's not working. What do I do? She won't listen to me or my other friends.](73738661577.md)
