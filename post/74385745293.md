sirtarantino: a guy walked ...

<p>sirtarantino:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a guy walked into the board room and said</p>
<p>&ldquo;hi sweetheart if you could fix me up a coffee real quick im meeting with the regional reports manager in like five minutes, thanks darling&rdquo;</p>
<p>and i just stared at him and coldly said</p>
<p>&ldquo;i am the regional reports manager&rdquo;</p>
<p>we are now twenty minutes into this board meeting and i dont think iâ€™ve ever seen a man look so embarrassed and afraid in my whole life</p>
