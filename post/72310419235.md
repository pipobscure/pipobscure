How do I know I havn't been...

***Wife:*** No kids today, you want to go for a round of Squash and a hot-tub? ***Me:*** Awesome, I'll get my gym stuff. ***undefined*** (time passes) ***Me:*** Honey have you seen my gym stuff anywhere? ***Wife:*** No. When did you see it last? ***undefined*** (time passes) ***Me:*** Actually, I don't even know if it was in 2012 or 2013. Hmmm... ***(p.s.:*** I did find it in the back of a drawer and am now off) ***(p.p.s.:*** changed "exercising" to "going to the gym" because I realized I was doing more running + post-run situps/crunches/pushups/etc...)
