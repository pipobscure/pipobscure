lokiloo: My Buddhist friend...

<p>lokiloo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My Buddhist friend was stopped by a Christian fellowship and asked if she would consider following the word of Jesus Christ. She replied, “No, thanks, but maybe next time around.”<br/><br/>I don’t think they got the joke but I nearly died laughing.</p>
