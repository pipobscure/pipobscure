 * [After ages on iPhone I tried a cheap android phone at the beginning of this year. It was a disaster not because android was bad, but rather because the phone was way too slow. I just bought a MotoG, and it’s a completely different story. It’s so good in fact that on the spur of the moment I sold my iPhone to a friend that wanted it. Combine that confidence with the €130 price and it’s clear that it’s a winner. I may get the 4G version when it comes out and give this to my son, but aside from that it hits a sweet spot.](88087280144.md)
