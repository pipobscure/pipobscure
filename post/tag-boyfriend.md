 * [But I don’t even want a boyfriend with rock hard abs and perfect hair, those are just “extra” things that I wouldn’t mind looking at. What I really want is a boyfriend who is passionate about something, anything, so much that he smiles and lights up when he talks about it. Who isn’t afraid to hold my hand in public and introduce me to everyone as “my girlfriend”, who stares at me when I’m not paying attention and smiles because he’s happy that he’s with someone like me. Most of all I want someone who doesn’t see me the way I see myself. I want someone that loves me more than I love myself, is that really too much to ask for?](80669515789.md)
