Warning: Legal Geeking Ahea...

<p><em>Warning: Legal Geeking Ahead!</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really worth while reading the decisions in these two cases from July 22nd 2014. Both are regarding the same issue and on the same level.</p>

<p>One claims that the federally operated exchange is not &ldquo;an exchange stablished by the state&rdquo; and the second claims the exact opposite.</p>

<p>Why should you read them? Because as soon as you get to the merits section it becomes painfully obvious, that the author for the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia couldn&rsquo;t find its ass with two hands. Rarely is such drivel being committed to paper. On the other hand the Court for the Fourth Circuit has judges that are capable of concise, explicative expression. This is actually a fun read, especially when you get to the concurring opinion by Senior Circuit Judge Davis who proceeds to, metaphorically, rip the appellants a new one.</p>

Judge Davis has just become my hero.</p>
