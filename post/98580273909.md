<p>realistically the space under my bed is very small so if a monster did in fact live there it would have to also be very small</p>
<p>it would be some kind of baby monster</p>
<p>i would have to look after it</p>

<p>The true horror: responsibility</p>

<p>My son often hides under my bed, because he wants to hear what the parents are talking about. So I have taken to checking under my bed for monsters. More often than not I find one.</p>
