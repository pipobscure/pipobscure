 * [Just remember that you‚Äôre standing on a planet that‚Äôs evolving And revolving at nine hundred miles an hour That‚Äôs orbiting at nineteen miles a second, so it‚Äôs reckoned, A sun that is the source of all our power. The sun and you and me and all the stars that we can see Are moving at a million miles a day In an outer spiral arm, at forty thousand miles an hour, Of the galaxy we call the ‚ÄòMilky Way‚Äô. Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars. It‚Äôs a hundred thousand light years side to side. It bulges in the middle, sixteen thousand light years thick, But out by us, it‚Äôs just three thousand light years wide. We‚Äôre thirty thousand light years from galactic central point. We go 'round every two hundred million years, And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions In this amazing and expanding universe. The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding In all of the directions it can whizz As fast as it can go, at the speed of light, you know, Twelve million miles a minute, and that‚Äôs the fastest speed there is. So remember, when you‚Äôre feeling very small and insecure, How amazingly unlikely is your birth, And pray that there‚Äôs intelligent life somewhere up in space, 'Cause there‚Äôs bugger all down here on Earth.](73516831955.md)
