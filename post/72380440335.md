gettingskinnyinamerica: Can...

<p>gettingskinnyinamerica:</p>

<blockquote><p>Can’t sleep because I’m a ball of anger tonight.</p>

<p>A mixture of family being dicks &amp; boys cutting me off, like we weren’t great friends before we saw each other naked make me furious.</p></blockquote>

That sounds logical. Family is annoying you all day with stupid comments. Some boys are dissing you cause they are too stupid to see what they might have had. 
<br/><br/>
And you deny yourself your beauty sleep, cause you are angry?
<br/><br/>
Ever heard the saying: The best revenge is a life well lived?

Make that in your case:
<br/><br/><b>A night slept soundly is the best revenge</b>
<br/><br/>
(and if you wake your entire family by snoring, all the better)
<br/>
Good night!
