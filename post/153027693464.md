title: Not so with politics. How all of us vote, collectively, matters a great deal. But how any one of us votes does not. Imagine a college professor told her class of 210 million students, &ldquo;Three months from now, we&rsquo;ll have a final exam. You won&rsquo;t get your own personal grade. Instead, I&rsquo;ll average all of your grades together, and everyone will receive the same grade.&rdquo; No one would bother to study, and the average grade would be an F. That in a nutshell is how democracy works.
