<blockquote><p>I am so damn tired of seeing these kinds of comments/articles/whatever. If youâ€™re not a parent, you are indeed allowed to have opinions, but seriously, nobody cares. Certainly not those of us with real life, flesh and blood children. </p>

<p>Oh, you wouldnâ€™t sit and stare at you phone while your toddler played on a play set at the mall? Good for you. I canâ€™t wait to see you put your perfect parenting principals into practice. </p>

<p>Or, my favorite, youâ€™d REASON with your child about why they canâ€™t have or do what they want. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜­</p>

<p>Show us how itâ€™s done, you pillars of parenting prowess!</p></blockquote>

<p>True that!</p>
