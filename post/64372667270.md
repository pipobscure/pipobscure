title: I think satisfying yourself is easier to do than satisfying the audience because the audience is a moving target. I mean, we&rsquo;re talking about &ldquo;the audience&rdquo; but who is the audience, you know what I&rsquo;m saying? It&rsquo;s all subjective. You should know no one better than you know yourself, and in being honest with yourself in making the movie, I think you can hit your intended target. Through being honest with yourself and doing something that&rsquo;s close to you, it&rsquo;ll connect with other people. They&rsquo;ll connect with the honesty of it. If you look at a filmmaker&rsquo;s filmography, their best work is the stuff that was closest to them, where they were trying to hit a target in themselves, not an audience target. I think that&rsquo;s the difference between making art and making commerce.

I think satisfying yourself is easier to do than satisfying the audience because the audience is a moving target. I mean, we’re talking about “the audience” but who is the audience, you know what I’m saying? It’s all subjective. You should know no one better than you know yourself, and in being honest with yourself in making the movie, I think you can hit your intended target. Through being honest with yourself and doing something that’s close to you, it’ll connect with other people. They’ll connect with the honesty of it. If you look at a filmmaker’s filmography, their best work is the stuff that was closest to them, where they were trying to hit a target in themselves, not an audience target. I think that’s the difference between making art and making commerce.

            *Source: Ryan Coogler (via howtocatchamonster) &ldquo;I think satisfying yourself is easier to do than satisfying the audience&rdquo; sounds a lot like masturbation. Which might not be accidental coming from a film guy. Hmmmmm&hellip;.*
