<p>As an older man on tumblr, I often find myself looking in the mirror thinking how clueless I am about what younger people think, what they really want out of life, what they value in this world. I know tumblr&rsquo;s vision is probably skewed, but I do think I am learning a lot here and it is inspiring to keep trying to make this a better place for all.</p>
