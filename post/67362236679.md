title: Dear LinkedIn, it&rsquo;s bad enough if someone I barely know wants me to join your totally overrated site and hands you my e-mail address for that purpose. I am punishing people who do so on my own, but if you then keep sending me reminders of this, it&rsquo;s you being obnoxious. What you have achieved with this is that I will never ever join LinkedIn for any reason what-so-ever, and that I will start informing people of your obnoxious behaviour. Please provide a link in you invite e-mails that enable me to inform you never ever to send e-mail ever again. Kind regards, Philipp Dunkel P.S.

<p>Dear LinkedIn,</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s bad enough if someone I barely know wants me to join your totally overrated site and hands you my e-mail address for that purpose. I am punishing people who do so on my own, but if you then keep sending me reminders of this, it&rsquo;s you being obnoxious.</p>

<p>What you have achieved with this is that I will never ever join LinkedIn for any reason what-so-ever, and that I will start informing people of your obnoxious behaviour.</p>

<p>Please provide a link in you invite e-mails that enable me to inform you never ever to send e-mail ever again.</p>

<p>Kind regards,
Philipp Dunkel</p>

<p>P.S.: <strong>I hereby give notice to anyone on the planet of the fact, that if you send me a LinkedIn invite, any relationship we might have had will remain theoretical and I reserve the right to send up to 1e9 e-mails with random content to you, basically sending your mail-program into oblivion.</strong></p>
