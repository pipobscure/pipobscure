<p>It is evident that rape-culture is a thing and we have come to accept that #NotAllMen is just a feeble excuse for silently accepting and promoting it.</p>

<p>And then there is an act of religiously motivated terror like that in Paris. The first commentary that I heard after the report was &ldquo;Not All Muslims&rdquo; are violent retrogrades. You know what: IT&rsquo;S THE SAME LAME EXCUSE</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m having none of it. I know that not all men are rapists, not all Muslims are terrorists and not all religions call for the unconditional annihilation of unbelievers. But I don&rsquo;t care. My tolerance is at its  end.</p>

<p>I refuse to make concessions for people peddling non-sense. If you want to pray in your own home and believe in bollocks of any kind, be my guest. That&rsquo;s your thing. But when you enter the public sphere your superstitions have no place.</p>

<p>And just in case you were wondering: I&rsquo;m not islamophobic I&rsquo;m islamomisic. (and christomisic, and religiomisic for that matter)</p>
