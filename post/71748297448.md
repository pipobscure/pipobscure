God is great. It’s so refreshing to have a father figure where I’m the one who doesn’t believe in him.

            *Source: Emily Axford (via pipobscure) While this is a good atheist fun quote, it also provides a good opportunity to declare the truth: I happen to have a set of parents that have always and unconditionally supported me. They have believed in me and helped me achieve whatever I have wanted. They were and are role-models for me. If I can manage to do even half as godd a job with my kids, I will have every right to be proud. So this is the public acknowledgement of these facts as well as of my gratitude to them. At the same time my parents did everything wrong and I&rsquo;m not going to make the same mistakes with my kids.*
