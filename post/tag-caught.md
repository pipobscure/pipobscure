 * [According to a speech by Phil Zimmerman [Atheists] are better educated and maybe even a little bit smarter. and only 0.2% of U.S. prisoners are atheists Doesn’t mean atheists are more ethical, just that we don’t get caught ;) Thanks to The Logic Police for pointing me at the speech. A fun read!](72589422139.md)
