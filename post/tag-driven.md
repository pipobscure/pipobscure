 * [Open collaboration groups tend to strive for consensus in their decisions. Consensus as an ideal is a worthwhile goal because it allows for all participants to have a direct influence on the decisions and therefore fosters participation and values the participants. However seeking consensus can also lead to a lack of progress because individual voices have the ability to block all progress. When we created CAcert, a community CA, we realized that this was not a sustainable model. So we decided to borrow the concept of “rough consensus” from the IETF and adapt it to our needs. This has served CAcert well and has been the single best model for collaborative group management I have yet encountered. To quote the CAcert Wiki](183713270154.md)
