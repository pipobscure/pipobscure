 * […and the market cannot compensate Mathew Ingram wrote a piece on GigaOM about a change in the google search algorithm to discourage mugshot sites and the often associated blackmail. He makes the case, not least with his title “first they came for the mugshot websites, but I said nothing” that this decision to actively discourage a set of sites is a slippery slope. The danger is that we will not know what will be hidden from us by google next. Google chooses what we see and don’t see He contrasts the fiction of “the right to be forgotten” that the EU is currently pushing, which would give the end user a choice in what will be remembered, versus Google deciding what will be forgotten by virtue of not being found. While I find the EU position to be an unrealistic fiction, I find this Google action to be a worrisome precedent. It is of course legitimate for Google, and that’s likely the argument they will put forth, to optimise for deducing the intent of the searcher and giving the best possible results. That is a specious argument though, because whether mugshot sites fit that intent depends on an assumption about intent that is decided on by google. Ultimately, it’s a decision that is made. The real issue is that the market cannot possibly have a chance to compensate. Usually, one would make the claim that since the filtering is beong done by a corporation and not a state entity, the market has a chance to correct any problems. This however assumes that consumers have an opportunity to notice. In the case of filtering the web consumers will never know precisely because they will not know what they are missing. Mathew’s worry about what Google will filter next is very valid. When it starts filtering things like Wiki-Leaks, or Snowden’s revelations, that would be a real problem. Especially since we will not know what we did not find and we won’t even know whether Google is filtering due to ideology or due to pressure from one or more states.](64214362742.md)

 * [About a year and a half ago I used GoogleMaps and got led to turn left the wrong way on a major thoroughfare. Well I didn’t blame Google, after all what did I expect. What I did instead is report the problem. I marked it, described the precise issue and jumped through all their hoops. In the end I was notified that my input was now part of Google Maps. YIPPEEH!!! Today I asked Google Maps again for directions. And guess what, it made the same goddamn mistake again. Not similar, THE FUCKING SAME MISTAKE that leads you down the wrong side of a highway. The same fucking mistake, that I fucking helped them fix more than a year ago. Now in my book, when you make a potentially dangerous error, that’s a mistake; if you are told and don’t fix it, it’s negligence; if you are told, and claim to have fixed it and don’t, then that’s gross negligence. And guess what. Gross negligence makes you liable even if you disclaim liability. Watch out Google, this is the way companies get sued into oblivion and I’d hate that.](81771980180.md)
