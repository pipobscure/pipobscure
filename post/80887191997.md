<p>I do! I actually bought their instant coffee a little bit ago and enjoy it. I was debating whether making a pot of Folgers or just a cup of instant yesterday and now I know that the answer is always instant.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is actually a saddening post. The choice between Folgers and instant? That&rsquo;s like choosing between pest and cholera?</p><p>How about selecting between different roasts prepared as espresso? I know this is snobbish and I&rsquo;m OK with that. But if the choice is between Folgers and instant, then I choose emigration.</p>
