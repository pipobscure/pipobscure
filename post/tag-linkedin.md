# Tag linkedin

 * [Dear LinkedIn, it’s bad enough if someone I barely know wants me to join your totally overrated site and hands you my e-mail address for that purpose. I am punishing people who do so on my own, but if you then keep sending me reminders of this, it’s you being obnoxious. What you have achieved with this is that I will never ever join LinkedIn for any reason what-so-ever, and that I will start informing people of your obnoxious behaviour. Please provide a link in you invite e-mails that enable me to inform you never ever to send e-mail ever again. Kind regards, Philipp Dunkel P.S.](67362236679.md)
