<p>kirstyintheskywithbutter:</p>

<blockquote><p>Having a delivery time of 1-5 for my new bed is so annoying because I can’t go anywhere between the hours of 1-5 incase it gets delivered &amp; I was out, or something.</p>
<p>It’s nearly 4pm, watch it get delivered BANG ON 5PM.</p></blockquote>

<p>I know the feeling, When I had my new bed delivered in February, I was on the phone with the company asking what happened, they wanted to deliver the bed that day, when the truck pulled up. Like it doesn&rsquo;t get any more last-minute.</p>
