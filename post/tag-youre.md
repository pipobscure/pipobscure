 * [You’re allowed to believe in a god. You’re allowed to believe unicorns live in your shoes for all I care. But the day you start telling me how to wear my shoes so I don’t upset the unicorns, I have a problem with you. The day you start involving the unicorns in making decisions for this country and this world. I have a big problem with you.](67251287415.md)

 * [Just remember that you’re standing on a planet that’s evolving And revolving at nine hundred miles an hour That’s orbiting at nineteen miles a second, so it’s reckoned, A sun that is the source of all our power. The sun and you and me and all the stars that we can see Are moving at a million miles a day In an outer spiral arm, at forty thousand miles an hour, Of the galaxy we call the ‘Milky Way’. Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars. It’s a hundred thousand light years side to side. It bulges in the middle, sixteen thousand light years thick, But out by us, it’s just three thousand light years wide. We’re thirty thousand light years from galactic central point. We go 'round every two hundred million years, And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions In this amazing and expanding universe. The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding In all of the directions it can whizz As fast as it can go, at the speed of light, you know, Twelve million miles a minute, and that’s the fastest speed there is. So remember, when you’re feeling very small and insecure, How amazingly unlikely is your birth, And pray that there’s intelligent life somewhere up in space, 'Cause there’s bugger all down here on Earth.](73516831955.md)
