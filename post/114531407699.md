***my requirements for sleeping at night:*** is the pillow cool enough? are my legs positioned so they don't put too much weight on each other? are my arms tucked in nicely and not at odd angles? can I stop thinking about the day's events? is enough of my body out from under the blanket that I won't overheat? are my toes safely tucked in to hide them from monsters? ***my requirements for sleeping in the morning:*** is the surface vaguely horizontal and not made entirely out of hornets
