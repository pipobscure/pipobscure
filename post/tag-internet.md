 * [It seems that there are still some like the LAUSD that have not realised yet, that you cannot lock down technology and still expect it to be useful. The LA-Times reported that LAUSD halts home use of iPads for students, which might just be the silliest thing to it could do. The one thing sillier is to truly believe that it could prevent this to begin with. But aside from all that, there is a much deeper question that should be raised. That is not “can we prevent students from surfing the net”, but “should we prevent students from surfing the net”. As has been previously discussed in what inner city kids know about social media kids don’t really need to be protected from the internet by people that know less about it than they do. We (and the LAUSD) should be proud that students circumvented the stupid restrictions so quickly and commend them for it. They should also not restrict students use of the tools that they were given. The LAUSD should be embarrassed by all of this. Not that their security measures where circumvented, but rather that they thought they were warranted and their reaction to the circumvention. Maybe the people at the LAUSD should be sent back to school; obviously they are not yet ready for the 21st century.](62519637603.md)

 * [The argument that the advent of the Internet somehow marks a Telecom Year Zero after which nothing will ever be the same can be made only by ignoring the actual history of literature. Look at Kafka’s obsession with telephones; or the way the phonograph, for Bram Stoker, mirrors the vampire as a machine for bringing the dead to life (or, conversely, storing the living in dead form); or at the obsessive attention Samuel Richardson’s Clarissa is forced to pay to ink and desks and messengers.](66087535004.md)
 * [The Washington Post recently had an article entitled How the Internet is killing the world’s languages in which the author expounded that a large set of languages are passing on. Throughout the article questions like “how can this be averted”, “how can languages be save” are asked like having more than 7000 languages is a good thing. Now I like language, and I love languages. Which is why I speak two like a native and another two to a level that I can hold an intelligent conversation. Thing is, that’s just for fun and they are all major languages. Truth be told from the perspective of benefit to the world, I don’t think more that a handful of languages are a good thing. Diversity is not a good thing in itself, nor is it a bad thing. It’s just a thing. There is this claim that language diversity is a cause for cultural diversity. Again, so what. There are a lot of things that are expressions of culture. And we certainly don’t want to keep all of them around. Guillotines were an expression of culture, so were witch-hunts. Do we really want to insist that all diversity and all culture is a good thing? Everything has its time and its time to end. Maybe it’s just the right time to let 7387 languages slip into oblivion.](69279740644.md)
