title: About a year and a half ago I used GoogleMaps and got led to turn left the wrong way on a major thoroughfare. Well I didn&rsquo;t blame Google, after all what did I expect. What I did instead is report the problem. I marked it, described the precise issue and jumped through all their hoops. In the end I was notified that my input was now part of Google Maps. YIPPEEH!!! Today I asked Google Maps again for directions. And guess what, it made the same goddamn mistake again. Not similar, THE FUCKING SAME MISTAKE that leads you down the wrong side of a highway. The same fucking mistake, that I fucking helped them fix more than a year ago. Now in my book, when you make a potentially dangerous error, that&rsquo;s a mistake; if you are told and don&rsquo;t fix it, it&rsquo;s negligence; if you are told, and claim to have fixed it and don&rsquo;t, then that&rsquo;s gross negligence. And guess what. Gross negligence makes you liable even if you disclaim liability. Watch out Google, this is the way companies get sued into oblivion and I&rsquo;d hate that.
