 * [And once again I noticed that I havenâ€™t seen anything from one of my favorite tumblrs in a while. I thought she might me on hiatus and went to her page and guess what! No hiatus, A bunch of good posts that I would have loved to see! Can anyone explain to me why tumblr would go and filter posts from people I actually chose to follow. I mean how strongly do you need me to indicate that this is actually stuff I want to see?](86094989404.md)
