<p>I just dropped half our household at household (due to the move) at the local women&rsquo;s shelter.</p>

<p> * 1 box of DVDs<br/>
 * 1 box of Books<br/>
 * 1 box of Womens Clothing<br/>
 * 1 box of Childrens clothing<br/>
 * 2 boxes of Toys<br/>
 * 1 box of Food (Rice, Pasta, Beans, &hellip;)</p>

<p>It made me feel acutely uncomfortable, because I felt the intense feeling of dislike rolling of these women mixed with fear and chuzpa and&hellip;</p>

<p>I watched these three slight women wrestle with these heavy and huge boxes that I had trouble with when loading. They seemed like the ant carrying the apple in the cartoons, except without any of the grace of the ant.</p>

<p>Suppressing my instinct to just pick up a box and carry it in I found it a challenge to accept that I was not welcome in their lair. Yet the fact that such places are needed is made abundantly clear by the radiating suspicion of these women.</p>

<p>This is likely the only situation I have actually experienced where I could glimpse what any minority experiences full force: the combination of overt welcome and covert distrust and dislike.</p>

<p>So while I would discourage white males to go around the local women&rsquo;s shelter for the experience, if you ever get the chance then pay attention to all the subliminal things going on. It can be a learning experience.</p>
