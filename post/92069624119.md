<p>nothing pisses me off more than the fact that 90% of women’s jeans have non-functioning pockets but baby clothes have proper pockets? what are babies carrying around that i’m not? baby wallets? fuck off</p>

<p>I did an experiment 7 months ago and compared my then <strong>6 month old’s</strong> jean pockets to mine. This was the result:</p>

<p>If this doesn’t prove how fucked up women’s fashion is I don’t know what will.</p>

<p>Come on! You must be over the age where you need a pacifier-pocket.</p><p>My theory is that since women have realised that they don&rsquo;t really need men, and can just keep one around as a plaything while they are infatuated, we men have conspired to create an artificial dependence. This way your man is the keeper/carrying-mule for phones, money, keys and assorted junk. What else are we good for?</p>
