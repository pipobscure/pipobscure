<p>Just as a reminder: <strong>Our society requires of anyone wanting to live within it the acceptance of our norms (laws).</strong> Among these norms is religious tolerance, an important achievement in the development of western civilisation. Never mistake that with <em>religious acceptance</em> however!  We only offer <em>religious tolerance</em> and <strong>not</strong> <em>religious acceptance</em>. <strong>Do not presume to foist any dictum of your superstition upon our society. Not as an excuse; not as a guiding principle; not as the basis for our norms.</strong></p>
