title: After ages on iPhone I tried a cheap android phone at the beginning of this year. It was a disaster not because android was bad, but rather because the phone was way too slow. I just bought a MotoG, and it&rsquo;s a completely different story. It&rsquo;s so good in fact that on the spur of the moment I sold my iPhone to a friend that wanted it. Combine that confidence with the &euro;130 price and it&rsquo;s clear that it&rsquo;s a winner. I may get the 4G version when it comes out and give this to my son, but aside from that it hits a sweet spot.

<p>After ages on iPhone I tried a cheap android phone at the beginning of this year. It was a disaster not because android was bad, but rather because the phone was way too slow.<br/>
I just bought a MotoG, and it&rsquo;s a completely different story. It&rsquo;s so good in fact that on the spur of the moment I sold my iPhone to a friend that wanted it. Combine that confidence with the â‚¬130 price and it&rsquo;s clear that it&rsquo;s a winner. I may get the 4G version when it comes out and give this to my son, but aside from that it hits a sweet spot.</p>
