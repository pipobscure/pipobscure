# Tag reject

 * [I reject the generally accepted notion that gentlemen wear imported suits, drive expensive cars, and dine at the finest high class restaurants. In many cases those guys are usually no more than rich, narcissistic, male chauvinists. Being wealthy does not make you a gentleman. A true gentleman is any man, wealthy or not, who behaves honorably, is a gracious host, is well mannered, and above all, treats everyone with kindness, dignity and respect. No matter who they are or where theyâ€™re from.](91357490929.md)
