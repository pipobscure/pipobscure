Conversation mid 2014

***Donald:*** Ok Hillary, what can I do to help you. ***Hillary:*** Well I don't know; after all you are a pretty sleazy fat-cat. ***Donald:*** True. I'm also a misogynist of the highest order. So endorsing you would probably do more harm than anything. ***Hillary:*** Well you could just endorse one of those bible-thumping numb-skulls over at the GOP. ***Donald:*** Nah, their people would actually like that. I have an idea though: what if I ran myself? ***Hillary:*** What do you mean, how's that going to help? ***Donald:*** Well if I run and just be me, like the offensive slime-ball I am, just more so then I bet the GOP would actually nominate me. Then you'd have to run against me and that should be fairly easy! ***Hillary:*** True. But what if you actually win? I mean I'm not the most popular person around, you know. ***Donald:*** Well then this country is going to hell in a hand-basket and you're better off getting the hell out anyhow. ***Hillary:*** Right, and you get to enjoy rooting in the shit. Ok you are on: run and we'll see what this country is really made of.
