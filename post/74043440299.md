            ***Question: *** How many weeks have you been doing keto and how many pounds have you lost so far? Would you recommend it to someone wanting to drop 30lbs in 3 months?

            ***Answer: *** 8 weeks &amp; I’ve dropped 24lbs! It’s different for everyone! Don’t go into it expecting to have the same loss as me, my body went into shock I think &amp; I’m really anal about it as well! I never go over my carb limit!
