 * [About a year and a half ago I used GoogleMaps and got led to turn left the wrong way on a major thoroughfare. Well I didn’t blame Google, after all what did I expect. What I did instead is report the problem. I marked it, described the precise issue and jumped through all their hoops. In the end I was notified that my input was now part of Google Maps. YIPPEEH!!! Today I asked Google Maps again for directions. And guess what, it made the same goddamn mistake again. Not similar, THE FUCKING SAME MISTAKE that leads you down the wrong side of a highway. The same fucking mistake, that I fucking helped them fix more than a year ago. Now in my book, when you make a potentially dangerous error, that’s a mistake; if you are told and don’t fix it, it’s negligence; if you are told, and claim to have fixed it and don’t, then that’s gross negligence. And guess what. Gross negligence makes you liable even if you disclaim liability. Watch out Google, this is the way companies get sued into oblivion and I’d hate that.](81771980180.md)
 * [I just heard the most cogent pro-choice argument by Kate Smurthwaite. She argues that even if a fetus is accepted to be a full human life, if a woman is asked to supply the use of her own anatomy to another being that is (or at least should be) her choice. This argument finally is a cogent argument that the time of the abortion or when life actually starts is totally irrelevant. Finally someone is arguing in a way that eliminates the tedious discussion on when life begins. And it’s finally an argument that, while we men may want to educate ourselves about the issues and be as supportive as we can be, our opinion on abortion is (or at least should be) ultimately irrelevant.](88237335897.md)
