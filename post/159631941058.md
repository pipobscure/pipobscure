<blockquote><p>“While stitching a cut on the hand of a 75 year old farmer, the doctor struck up a conversation with the old man. Eventually the topic got around to Donald Trump and his role as the Republican Nominee for President. The old farmer said, ” Well, as I see it, Donald Trump is like a ‘Post Tortoise’.“ Not being familiar with the term, the doctor asked him what a &lsquo;post tortoise’ was. The old farmer said, &ldquo;When you’re driving down a country road and you come across a fence post with a tortoise balanced on top, that’s a post tortoise.” The old farmer saw the puzzled look on the doctor’s face so he continued to explain. “You know he didn’t get up there by himself, he doesn’t belong up there, he doesn’t know what to do while he’s up there, he’s elevated beyond his ability to function, and you just wonder what kind of dumb ass put him up there to begin with.”</p></blockquote>
