 * [Dear LinkedIn, it’s bad enough if someone I barely know wants me to join your totally overrated site and hands you my e-mail address for that purpose. I am punishing people who do so on my own, but if you then keep sending me reminders of this, it’s you being obnoxious. What you have achieved with this is that I will never ever join LinkedIn for any reason what-so-ever, and that I will start informing people of your obnoxious behaviour. Please provide a link in you invite e-mails that enable me to inform you never ever to send e-mail ever again. Kind regards, Philipp Dunkel P.S.](67362236679.md)
 * [I have just received an e-mail from Pebble (their Pebble-Info list) and am really disappointed in them as a company. I backed them during their Kickstater project. The Pebble-Info newsletters have so far always been about directly Pebble related products, such as new apps or watch-faces. Today’s email however promoted all kinds of junk from third parties. It’s obvious, that they have sold out and are now sending spam to their subscribers. And that makes me really disappointed in them as a company. They should focus on their core strengths (awesome products) rather than sell out their customers.](69681682112.md)
