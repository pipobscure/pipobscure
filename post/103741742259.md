title: I really don&rsquo;t want to hear this crap about &ldquo;race-discrimination&rdquo;, &ldquo;rape-culture&rdquo; and the like any more. I&rsquo;m a white middle aged male and I&rsquo;m sick of it! Now before you go all apeshit at me, let me explain what I mean. More than a century ago slaves were freed and it became law that truly all men should be equal. Almost 100 years ago, women got the vote and it was established into law that there is gender equality. About 50 years ago it was reiterated that race should not be a criterion. And in 2014 youths are being shot simply for being black-skinned, women are molested simply for walking down the street, people run scared because their gender identity doesn&rsquo;t match what some scatterbrained ass thinks it should. I don&rsquo;t want a world where race is an issue. I don&rsquo;t want a world where gender is an issue. I don&rsquo;t want a world where people have to be rightfully scared simply because of who they are. I want a world where race is what it is, an evolutionary characteristic of ones DNA. I want a world where gender is part accident at birth. Where gender identity is truly irrelevant because no one cares what you identify as and just people accept your word for it. Now I realise that this is not the world we live in, but I want it to be the world we strive for. A world where I don&rsquo;t hear about race-discrimination or rape-culture because there is no such thing. Now until we have such a world keep screaming and protesting and ranting. I might not want to hear it, but we have to hear it if we ever want to get over that crap.
