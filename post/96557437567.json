Both have found a few friends already and are happy to go back. So it seems as if school is working out alright.</p>\n\n<p>In other news: I have a sever toothache since Monday. Bad enough that I went to the dentist today. Any case, I have a major infection on one tooth that I had a root canal on about a year ago. It will need recrowning so we are talking a multi visit thing. For now I&rsquo;m on a course of antibiotics for the infection and pain relievers for the pain. On the 18th I&rsquo;ll get rid of the old crown and then we&rsquo;ll see. Yikes, it&rsquo;s going to be a painful month.</p>"}}
