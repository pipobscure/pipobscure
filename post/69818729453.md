<p>I’m hanging out in Budapest for the weekend. While in the hotel elevator, I overheard this American couple asking the same stupid question that every American that leaves her country for the first time asks:</p>

<p><em>Why do they number the floors differently?</em></p>

<p>After I resisted the urge to scream and explain the concept of cultural and linguistic differences to them, I decided to write a short post with the actual boring explanation:</p>

<p>In most European languages, the word for <em>floor</em> does not mean the same exact thing. Instead the French word <em>etage</em> or the German <em>Stock</em> actually mean something like <em>added level</em>. So of course the <em>first added level</em> is the not the <em>ground level</em> but the one above.</p>

<p>So simple and yet it has challenged travellers for ages.</p>
