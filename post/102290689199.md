<p>For the first time in history the U.S. Has something resembling a health care system worthy of a civilised nation and they have nothing better to do than complain about that very fact.</p>

<p>Just give it 50 years and Obama will be categorised together with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln as one of the greatest presidents in history.</p>

<p>Children will learn in school:</p>

<p> - Washington brought freedom to half the population<br/>
 - Abraham Lincoln to the other half<br/>
 -  Obama made sure they enjoyed that freedom in good health</p>
