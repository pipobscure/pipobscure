While I find the EU position to be an unrealistic fiction, I find this Google action to be a worrisome precedent. It is of course legitimate for Google, and that&rsquo;s likely the argument they will put forth, to optimise for deducing the intent of the searcher and giving the best possible results.

This however assumes that consumers have an opportunity to notice. In the case of filtering the web consumers will never know precisely because they will not know what they are missing. Mathew&rsquo;s worry about what Google will filter next is very valid. When it starts filtering things like Wiki-Leaks, or Snowden&rsquo;s revelations, that would be a real problem. Especially since we will not know what we did not find and we won&rsquo;t even know whether Google is filtering due to ideology or due to pressure from one or more states.
