Instead of saying “I don’t have time” try saying “it’s not a priority,” and see how that feels. Often, that’s a perfectly adequate explanation. I have time to iron my sheets, I just don’t want to. But other things are harder. Try it: “I’m not going to edit your résumé, sweetie, because it’s not a priority.” “I don’t go to the doctor because my health is not a priority.” If these phrases don’t sit well, that’s the point. Changing our language reminds us that time is a choice. If we don’t like how we’re spending an hour, we can choose differently.

            *Source: Unknown (via alecxander-j) I catch myself sometimes sayin &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time&rdquo; not because it sounds bad to me as &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a priority&rdquo;, but it sounds bad to others that want me to do things. To it sounds just right to say &ldquo;it so low in priority that it didn&rsquo;t even make it into the to 10000 list of things I need to do&rdquo;*
