 * [Ghost touts itself as “just a blogging platform” and that’s a good thing. When I heard the announcement at the beginning of the year, I was psyched. Finally something a bit more sensible to replace Wordpress. And then Ghost was released. I had a long look at it and did a code-review, and in the end I have to say it’s dead on arrival, or at least I hope it will be. The idea of doing a simple “just blogging” platform is great, and the UI thoughts are great as well, but the actual implementation is horrific. Yes they abandoned PHP in favour of NodeJS to gain some hype, and good on them. But they basically took all the mistakes that were made implementing Wordpress and reimplemented them using NodeJS. They built a monolith that pretends to be modular, without actually understanding what modular means. shudder They mixed concerns like crazy, made it pretty much impossible to embed it into something larger, and on and on. Every architectural mistake made by Wordpress has been repeated. And in return you don’t event get the one single redeeming feature of Wordpress](67252014534.md)
 * [A bit ago I wrote a post about Ghost in which I made the claim that they had pretty much screwed it up. Of course this presumes that there is a common understanding of what that and “doing it right” means. I have been doing a lot of thinking about that for a while and have spoken to a few people (read non-tech, blog writers). By now I have come to some conclusions; too many to put into one post](68352397942.md)
