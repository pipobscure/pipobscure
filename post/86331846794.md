A liberal bias? Do you mean we care about the poor, the sick, and the maimed? Do we care about whether people are being shot every day on the streets of America? If thatâ€™s liberal, so be it.

            *Source: Helen Thomas (via justinacuff) I never understood how liberal could ever be used by conservatives as an epithet of abuse. After all, it simply means a political or social philosophy advocating the freedom of the individual or exactly what their ideal America is all about. It&rsquo;s sort of like the Pope denouncing people as orthodox catholics Dear America, this word does not mean what your think it does!*
