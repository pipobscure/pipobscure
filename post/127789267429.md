jkottke: BuzzFeed’s Tom Chi...

<p>jkottke:</p>

<blockquote><p>BuzzFeed’s Tom Chivers asked several atheists How They Find Meaning In A Purposeless Universe.</p>

<blockquote><p>The way I find meaning is the way that most people find meaning, even religious ones, which is to get pleasure and significance from your job, from your loved ones, from your avocation, art, literature, music. People like me don’t worry about what it’s all about in a cosmic sense, because we know it isn’t about anything. It’s what we make of this transitory existence that matters.</p></blockquote>

<p>These kinds of questions always make me think of Richard Feynman on beauty, science, and belief.</p>
