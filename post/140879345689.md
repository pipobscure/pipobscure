Jimmy was in the garden and...

<p>Jimmy was in the garden and killed a honeybee. His dad saw it and was shocked, so he said: &ldquo;Jimmy, because you killed that honeybee, you&rsquo;ll not get honey for a month!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later that day, the father caught Jimmy ripping the wings of a butterfly. So he said: &ldquo;Jimmy, because you ripped the wings of a butterfly, there&rsquo;ll be no butter for you for a month!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night, mom was making dinner and saw a cockroach. She stepped on it. Jimmy saw and asked his dad: &ldquo;Should I tell her or will you?&rdquo;</p>
