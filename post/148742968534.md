A Sainsbury’s spokesperson said an investigation into the incident was continuing, adding: “We sincerely appologise to Thomas and Josh. We are an inclusive retailer and employer and do not tolerate discrimination in our stores. We will take appropriate action once we’ve concluded our investigation with our security contractor.”

            *Source: Dear Sainsbury&rsquo;s, you don&rsquo;t just need to appologise but also clearly instruct your security to escort any bigot that makes such a complaint out of your store. @sainsburys*
