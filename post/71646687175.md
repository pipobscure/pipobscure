title: Every American should know basic math. Every American should understand the logical underpinnings to coding, the way conditional clauses work and the cyclical way in which systems are constructed. Americans should know that the way a website works isn&rsquo;t the way a video game works which isn&rsquo;t the way a bank&rsquo;s database works, but they don&rsquo;t need to learn to &ldquo;code&rdquo; all of those things. Just as every American doesn&rsquo;t need to get certified as a mechanic, but should know how to change a tire, every American should know how computer systems work in the abstract but doesn&rsquo;t need to code.

Every American should know basic math. Every American should understand the logical underpinnings to coding, the way conditional clauses work and the cyclical way in which systems are constructed. Americans should know that the way a website works isn’t the way a video game works which isn’t the way a bank’s database works, but they don’t need to learn to “code” all of those things. Just as every American doesn’t need to get certified as a mechanic, but should know how to change a tire, every American should know how computer systems work in the abstract but doesn’t need to code.
