rocksymom: One of those gag...

<p>rocksymom:</p>

<blockquote><p>One of those gag guns that shoots out a flag that says “bang” but on my car and instead it says “I’m using cruise control, either pass or don’t”.</p>

<p>Maybe it could be one of the aqua doodle things so then I could change it to helpful things like “your blinker is on” and “you’re obviously drunk, pull over and try again later”.</p></blockquote>

<p>When I get my next car, I&rsquo;m definitely getthing this rear display for that very reason.</p>
