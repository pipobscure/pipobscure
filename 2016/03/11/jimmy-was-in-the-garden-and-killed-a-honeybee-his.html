        <!-- <p>Jimmy was in the garden and killed a honeybee. His dad saw it and was shocked, so he said: “Jimmy, because you killed that honeybee, you’ll not get honey for a month!”</p>

<p>Later that day, the father caught Jimmy ripping the wings of a butterfly. So he said: “Jimmy, because you ripped the wings of a butterfly, there’ll be no butter for you for a month!”</p>

<p>That night, mom was making dinner and saw a cockroach. She stepped on it. Jimmy saw and asked his dad: “Should I tell her or will you?”</p>
