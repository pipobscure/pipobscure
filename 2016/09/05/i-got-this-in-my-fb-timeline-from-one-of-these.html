I got this in my FB-Timeline from one of these joke sites. Usually there’s a bunch of dad-jokes that give one a quick giggle but that aren’t really all that funny.</p>

<p>Any case, this one made gave me quite a bit to think about.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Differing perspectives</li>
  <li>Propagand in news-media</li>
  <li>How prevalent antisemitism is not just in “Arab Newspapers”</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s definitely worth giving a bit of thought to what it is we consume in our news-media, and it’s definitely worth it to go out of ones way to try give some differing opinions a read as well.</p>
