            <p>Iâ€™m going to rewrite the harry potter series and itâ€™s going to be called Hermione Granger and The Glorious Glock where she gets a gun and shoots voldemort through the skull and then everyone is free to continue their education in peace. Itâ€™ll be 3.5 pages long.Â </p>

          <p>theyâ€™re in Great Britain<br />
where in the world is an 11-year-old black girl going to get a gun</p>

        <p>the store</p>

      <p>Britain isnâ€™t America. You canâ€™t just walk into a random supermarket and buy a ton of guns. In fact, a gun is several hundred pounds each due to you needing to have a separate license for each one. Then you also need to have it where no one could accidentally find it and if anyone apart from you knows where the gun is, you lose your license and gun. I think it has to be locked up in a position no one will ever find it in.</p>

      <p>Pretty much, an eleven year old kid is not gonna get a gun in Britain.</p>

    <p>she goes to a wizard school with a three headed dog in the broom closet.</p>

  <p>i feel like some ppl r havin trouble understandin the concept so i illustrated it</p>

  <p>(my headcanon is that she is promoted to new dumbledore and she is twice as gayer than the last one)</p>

<p>It getâ€™s even worse. This is in Britain; the preferred weapon when kids play cops &amp; robbers is a bloody whistle! They donâ€™t even think about a gun unless they are playing America.</p>

<p>So this kid goes to a wizarding school; one would think this kid wouldnâ€™t even want to get a gun. Instead that kid would opt for some truly terrifying magical weapon.</p>

<p>So sorry, but this head-cannon cannot work. ðŸ˜€</p>
