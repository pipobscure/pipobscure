        <!-- <p>Can someone explain to me why the media portray U.S. politics is like a bloody high-school drama?</p>

<p>I mean there is Hillary being portrayed as this mean lying bitch that is still so in love with her beau Billy that she keeps writing “Mrs. President” in her notebooks with hearts over the i. Except that she’s not actually that big a liar or mean or a bitch.</p>

<p>In reality she has spent her entire life working to make things just bit better. And finally she realised: well there is this top job and I can actually do it.</p>

<p>Then you have Donald, your classic jock bully that goes around insulting and pushing around everyone. But no-one minds because he’s like the captain of the football team and what not.</p>

<p>In reality Donald is in fact an obnoxious bully that has never grown out of being a pubescent asshat. He’s getting away with it because we all prefer the soap-opera like teen drama to actually mature people concerned with the world.</p>

<p>This would be funny if this wasn’t going to impact everyones bloody lives. And with everyone I mean every single person on the planet.</p>

<p>This thing should be no contest! If the electorate were even half way sane this should be a landslide loss for Trump the likes of which haven’t been seen. Instead we have seemingly intelligent people make statements like:</p>

<p>“I can’t vote for Hillary because she’s such a liar” “I’ll vote Trump because he has a plan” “You shouldn’t take Trump literally, you need to take him seriously”</p>

<p>Come on, get your head out of your arse. At this point it should have become abundantly clear that if you are a human being that has any values at all, Hillary Clinton is the only candidate to vote for. If you can’t get over your ingrained misogyny even when presented with an alternative that is so blatantly against everything we as humans have accomplished over the last 200 years, you need to have a good look in the mirror and tell it to your own face: “I am a deplorable asshole”</p>
