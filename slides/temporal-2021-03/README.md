# Summary of changes
## & delegate reviews

---

## Removal of observable `from()` calls

- Removed the single monkeypatching points that affect deserialization of time zone and calendar IDs
- Background:
  - [proposal-temporal#294](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/294)
  - [proposal-temporal#1293](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/1293)


---

## Removal of observable `from()` calls

- Impact: some use cases now require patching all of Temporal
  - Globally adding a new time zone or calendar
  - Replacing builtin time zone data with an updated version
  - Patching a bug in builtin time zone or calendar data
  - Limiting code to only using the ISO calendar or UTC time zone
  - Ensuring cross-browser identical results
- There are other ways to achieve similar results
  - If backwards-compatible, we may ask for consensus to add one in future


---

## ‚õèÔ∏è Other minor changes

- From delegate reviews
  - Name changes to clarify ISO vs general operations
  - Improved precision of language re: mutability, time zones
  - Observable property access order on options objects
- Minor bugfixes

# What is still open?

---

## ü™¢ ISO String Extensions

- In January we talked about standardizing extensions to the ISO 8601 string format
- `2020-08-05T20:06:13+09:00[Asia/Tokyo][u-ca=japanese]`
- Bracketed time zone annotation is already a _de facto_ standard
  - But published nowhere
- Bracketed calendar annotation is new

---

## ü™¢ ISO String Extensions

- [Internet Draft, "Date and Time on the Internet"](https://ryzokuken.dev/draft-ryzokuken-datetime-extended/documents/rfc-3339.html)
- Presented at IETF 110, working group chartered
- Intended to align with whatever gets standardized
  - No subsequent changes expected, though

---

## üî¢ Intl.NumberFormat

- Names of a small, fixed set of rounding modes in Temporal
  - `roundingMode: 'halfExpand'`, `'ceil'`, `'floor'`, `'trunc'`
- Aligns with Intl.NumberFormat V3 proposal
  - [proposal-intl-numberformat-v3#7](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-numberformat-v3/issues/7)
- Intl.NumberFormat V3 adds more rounding modes than just these four
  - The NumberFormat proposal might seek consensus for adding more modes to Temporal in the future

---

## üìÖ Month Code Format

- String format for `monthCode` property
- e.g. `Temporal.now.plainDate('chinese').monthCode === "M03"`
  - `"M05L"` for leap months, etc.
- Shared between Temporal and ICU4X
- No subsequent changes expected

---

## üõ£Ô∏è Expectation around parallel standardizations

- We have no reason to expect more changes to the ISO string format, the rounding modes, or the month code format
- Should there be a motivated change in any of these, we expect to come back to committee and ask for the associated change in Temporal

- [#1425](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/1424) Editorial improvements

---

## üéõÔ∏è Implementer feedback

- We are asking for Stage 3 because we believe implementer and real-world feedback is necessary to proceed
- Based on feedback from implementers, we may ask for consensus to change details
  - e.g. to improve optimizability of calendar/time zone protocol

---

## üêú We will also fix bugs

- Bugs may come up due to implementer and real-world feedback
- [#1415](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/1415) Algorithm edge case

# üó£ Discussions

---

## Hallway discussion

- A subgroup discussed some of the remaining queue items yesterday
- We have proposals to present to the plenary
- Ask for Stage 3 conditional on the proposal being changed in these ways
- I hope I'm summarizing correctly; if not, please jump in

---

## Subclassing (1/2)

- Remove support for `Symbol.species` from all Temporal classes
- In instance methods that construct an instance, always construct an instance of the builtin
- In static methods that construct an instance, do not use `this` as the constructor

---

## Subclassing (2/2)

```js
class MyPlainDateTime extends Temporal.PlainDateTime {}
const mpdt = new MyPlainDateTime(2021, 3, 9, 'iso8601');
mpdt.add({ days: 1 })
  // ‚Ü™ Temporal.PlainDateTime instance
MyPlainDateTime.from('2021-03-10')
  // ‚Ü™ Temporal.PlainDateTime instance
```

---

## Comparison (1/2)

- Now that `Array.prototype.sort()` is stable, 
- `Temporal.(type).compare()` does not take the calendar or time zone into account
- `ZonedDateTime.compare()` works like `Instant.compare()`
- `PlainDate`, `PlainDateTime`, and `PlainYearMonth` compare the ISO dates
- No change to `equals()` method

---

## Comparison (2/2)

```js
const g = Temporal.PlainDate.from({ year: 2021, month: 3, day: 10, calendar: 'gregory' });
  // ‚Ü™ 2021-03-10[u-ca=gregory]
const h = Temporal.PlainDate.from({ year: 5781, month: 6, day: 26, calendar: 'hebrew' });
  // ‚Ü™ 2021-03-10[u-ca=hebrew]
Temporal.PlainDate.compare(g, h)
  // previously: -1
  // proposed: 0
```

---

## Mutability due to calendars and time zones

- Queue item from Kevin

---

## Conceptual consistency of time zones

- Queue item from Jordan

---

## Stage 3 criteria

- ‚úÖ The solution is complete, no more work possible without impl. experience, significant usage, external feedback
- ‚úÖ Complete spec text
  - (conditional, on resolution of the previously listed pending issues)
- ‚ùì Designated reviewers have signed off on the spec text
- ‚ùì ECMAScript editors have signed off on the spec text

## Removal of observable `from()` calls

Previously:
```js
const origFrom = Temporal.Calendar.from;
Temporal.Calendar.from = function (calendarLike) {
  if (calendarLike === 'custom-calendar')
    return new MyCustomCalendar();
  return origFrom(calendarLike);
}
Temporal.PlainDate.from('1999-12-31[u-ca=custom-calendar]');
// => Party like it's 1999
```

---

## Removal of observable `from()` calls

- Advantages:
  - üëç React to **short-notice geopolitical changes** in time zones and calendars, before environments are able to ship updates
  - üëç **Limit damage** by users making `MyCustomCalendar` available globally
- Disadvantages:
  - üëé Endorses **monkeypatching** builtin objects
  - üëé **Early running code** can't defend against late running code

  - üëé **Early running code** can't defend against late running code

---

## Removal of observable `from()` calls

- Add a 'resolver' parameter for custom calendar and time zone IDs
- Plan to develop an API and submit a needs-consensus PR for this in the future

---

## Removal of observable `from()` calls

(just an example, not a proposed API)
```js
function calendarResolver(id) {
  if (id === 'custom-calendar')
    return new MyCustomCalendar();
  return Temporal.Calendar.from(id);
}
Temporal.PlainDate.from('1999-12-31[u-ca=custom-calendar]', { calendarResolver });
```

---

## üíø Calendar and TimeZone Records

- Should a calendar or a time zone Get all its methods at the entry point?
- Store them in a Calendar or TimeZone Record, analogous to PromiseCapability Record
- Unlike PromiseCapability Record, this has implications for user code
- Background: [proposal-temporal#1294](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/1294)

---

## üíø Calendar and TimeZone Records

- I've investigated this
- Has some advantages, but also disadvantages
  - üëç Spec text more concise
  - üëç Fewer observable Gets in some situations
  - üëé More observable Gets in other situations
  - üëé Odd behaviour around mutated prototypes
- Champions have not discussed it yet
- I personally don't think it's an improvement

---

## üíø Calendar and TimeZone Records

Should these `‚ùî` be 12 or 13 and should any of them be different?

```js
const p = Temporal.now.plainDateTimeISO();
Temporal.Calendar.prototype.monthsInYear = () => 13;

p.monthsInYear  // => ‚ùî
p.calendar.monthsInYear(p)  // => ‚ùî
p.toPlainDate().monthsInYear // => ‚ùî
p.toPlainYearMonth().monthsInYear  // => ‚ùî
```

---

## Month codes

- Some calendars have leap months inserted at different points in the year
- Temporal needs to have two ways to refer to months:
  - in numerical order (`month`, e.g. `3`)
  - stable across years (`monthCode`, e.g. `"M03"`)
- Background: [proposal-temporal#1203](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/1203)
