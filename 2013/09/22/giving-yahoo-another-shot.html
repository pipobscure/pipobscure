    <h1>Giving Yahoo! another shot</h1>
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I recently met @davglass at NodeConf.eu.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Before I get started let me use this space to give a shoutout to @Cianomaidin of <a href="http://www.nearform.com">nearform</a> for putting on one of the best conferences ever.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>anyhow i met this yahoo and he was really bubbling over about the products of this internet dinosaur <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a>. (Love bad puns)</p>

<p>While Yahoo! hasn’t really been the company I would associate with the word “innovative” over the last couple of years, it is a pretty cool story. An internet methusalem, that is pretty spry for its age that is actually still doing pretty cool stuff. (For details about alcoholic software please speak to @davglass)</p>

<p>So I decided to give Yahoo! another shot at getting integrated into my personal toolset. I will write down here every once in a while how the experience goes, but so far i like it.</p>

<p>Yahoo-Mail is a much better fit for how i use E-Mail than GMail ever was. I just had a look at Yahoo-Groups and will try to organize the Viennese NodeJS community using it.</p>

<p>In short, I like what i am seeing. @davglass is an awesome ambassador for Yahoo!</p>

<p>P.S.: I want to be @davglass when I grow up ;)</p>
