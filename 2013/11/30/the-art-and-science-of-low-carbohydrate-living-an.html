  <p>The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living: An Expert Guide to Making the Life-Saving Benefits of Carbohydrate Restriction Sustainable and Enjoyable [Stephen D. Phinney, Jeff S. Volek] on Amazon.com. *FREE* shipping on qualifying offers. Carbohydrate restricted diets are commonly practiced but seldom taught. As a result, doctors, dietitians, nutritionists</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This book is a must read for anyone on a keto diet. It helps so much if you understand precisely what is going on in your body.</p>

<p><strong>Like:</strong> you lack potassium, but the cause is not that you eat too little of it. You could eat it in concentrated form and still lack it, because you body canâ€™t absorb it because of a lack of salt.</p>

<p>Which is why <strong>my one tip</strong> is: <em>If you are going low/no-carb, then you should drink a pint of salty vegetable broth every day. It will provide you with salt, and the water will help you eat less as well.</em></p>
