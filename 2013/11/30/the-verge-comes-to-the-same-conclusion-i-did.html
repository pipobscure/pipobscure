    <title>That vs. just glancing at your watch, makes a huge difference. Since I have the Pebble, I have become much more appreciative in meetings, because rather than signalling my conversational partner that any bleeping text is more important then what they have to say, I now suggest by looking at my watch that they should move it. So meetings end up shorter, more efficient and more cordial, by me giving my attention to the other person and at the same time speeding them up.</title>

<a href="http://thisistheverge.tumblr.com/post/68467978369/the-verge-at-work-using-the-pebble-smartwatch-to">The Verge</a> comes to the same conclusion I did.</p>

<p>The Pebble-Watch has a singular nifty feature and that is notifications. 99% of all texts are so unimportant itâ€™s not even worth taking the phone out of your pocket. But 1% is so crucial, that you simply cannot miss them. So unless you have a Pebble, you are forced to check every text you get by grabbing your phone.</p>
