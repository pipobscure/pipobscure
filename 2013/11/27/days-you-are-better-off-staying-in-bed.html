    <h1>Days you are better off staying in bed</h1>
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>yesterday was definitely one of those. First a totally unproductive day where the height of achievement was checking on other peoples work. Then a tough evening meeting until like 5:30</p>

<p>As if that were not enough, and I not down enough, I go by Starbucks on my way to the station, and they totally mess up my (espresso doppio con panna) by just adding extra milk. Like what’s with that?</p>

<p>At the station I decided to drop by McDonalds for some salad and again they mess up the order (Greek salad instead of Italian).</p>

<p>Then after that, and just reaching the train, it’s delayed at the next stop.</p>

<p>It’s obvious that the world has to be in a conspiracy against me. How can they torment me so? I mean these are serious attacks on my person how come this is not front-page news?</p>

<p>After all news shouldn’t be the exclusive property of <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/oddnews/driver-offended-by-%E2%80%9Cwh0-r8x%E2%80%9D-license-plate-221720503.html">dumb people that can’t spell for sh**</a>.</p>

<p>Come on they are complaining about being offended by a license plate, while people are going thirsty and hungry here. That’s just obnoxious.</p>
