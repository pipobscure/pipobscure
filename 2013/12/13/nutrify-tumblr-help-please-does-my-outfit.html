<blockquote>
  <p>Tumblr help please. Does my outfit match? Flowery dress and glittery flowery tights with my punk-ish boots (I’d love to stay “barefoot” with shoe type). And then red sweater.</p>

  <p>Do the styles go together or am I off base?</p>

  <p>Thank youuuu</p>

  <p>Happy and Safe Friday the 13th!</p>

<p>Take it from an old man. Clothes work in a miraculous way. Thing is if you truly like a combination, it will work. Because if you feel good about a look, you project that outward, and that is what makes you able to pull it of.</p>

<p>Think about how some men can’t wear suits, cause they just look out of place in them. That’s not because the suit doesn’t work, it’s because they don’t project “I look awesome in a suit” because they don’t feel that.</p>

<p>Same goes for all clothing. Think how Mick Jagger can pull of a pair of Jeans, a ripped T and a funky bandana, while most guys his age couldn’t. The reason is simply because they aren’t comfortable with themselves in those clothes.</p>

<p>So when you ask Tumblr if the outfit works, the answer is most certainly NO, not because it doesn’t work, but because you don’t feel sure about yourself in those clothes. Now if you asked yourself, while looking in a mirror: “Do I like that look?” and answer truthfully “YES” then that outfit will work.</p>

<p>What it’s worth, I think it goes over well, but then I’m just an old man.
