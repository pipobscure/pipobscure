<blockquote>
  <p>In social issues class today our professor held up a black book and was like “this book is red” and we were all “no” and he said “yes it is” and we were just all “that’s not right” and he turned it around and the back cover was red and he said “Don’t tell somebody they’re wrong until you’ve seen things from their point of view” </p>

  <p>that speaks to me </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s a pretty good story and a point worth remembering.</p>
