<blockquote>
  <p>Tonight’s dinner was a typical Portuguese meal. The literal translation would be “Cod with all of them”. It’s dumb, I know. We eat this a lot during the winter time and most families eat this on their Christmas eve dinner.</p>

  <p>It’s basically a bunch of boiled veggies (Portuguese kale, cabbage, carrots, chickpeas and potatoes), boiled eggs and boiled salted cod (that has been in water for about 2 days, to remove the salt), all smothered in olive oil, in the true Mediterranean style. </p>

  <p>We also have a version with meat, we call it a Portuguese Boil, and it’s basically the same veggies (but switch the chickpeas with white beans) with beef, pork, chicken and a lot of sausages (basically chorizo and blood sausage).</p>

  <p>And now my mom is making “old laundry” with the leftovers. We basically chop up all the veggies, cod and eggs and turn into a salad to eat on the next day.</p>

  <p>You can sure tell how poor this country is by its food. But I still love my poor people food.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most traditional food is “poor people food”:</p>

<p>Viennese Schnitzel: use old breadcrumbs to pretend your piece of meat is thicker Escargots: eat snails, because you can’t even afford the salad they feasted on Calves Brains: well that’s all that the butcher would give after selling of intestines, liver and kidneys to the “richer poor”</p>

<p>Yet all these are now “traditional food” somewhere. Some are even considered delicacies. Goes to show, cheap food must not necessarily be bad food.</p>

<p>In fact the most ingenious cooks are not those that can cook a 12 course meal with ingredients for thousands of €/£/$ but rather those that can take a few simple ingredients and envision them in a deliciously unusual combination.</p>
