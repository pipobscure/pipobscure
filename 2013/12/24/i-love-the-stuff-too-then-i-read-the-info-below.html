    <title>**PROTEIN, CARBOHYDRATE, AND FAT** There are 3 g protein per serving of Baileys, and 25 g of carbohydrate with 20 grams coming from sugar or sucrose. There are 13 g of fat with 8 grams coming from saturated fat. This basically means that two shots of Baileys contains about the same amount of sugar as a can of regular soda, and can be considered a high fat beverage.</title>
