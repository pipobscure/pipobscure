<p>Pastafarians of the world, how can you expect your religion to be taken seriously or even seriously unseriously or even at all? Ever religion worth its salt needs to have at least two, better more, sects!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/workinpana/96691107/" title="the gospel... by workinpana, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/34/96691107_63f2be0b17.jpg" alt="the gospel..." /></a></p>

<p>To rectify this egregious oversighgt, I propose we divide pastafarians into two major camps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>those that worship his holy noodliness by eating pasta</li>
  <li>the (self)righteous ones that call such behaviour blasphemous - they avoid anything that could even remotely be construed as pasta in their diet</li>
</ul>

<p>We could then avoid having viscious debates about pasta (dietary item vs. object of adoration) by grudgingly glaring at each other.</p>

<p>Of course once we have sects, sectarian conflict is mandatory. And the really heavy hitters have shown that any religion in the upper league needs to have had a few religious wars.</p>

<p>Considering the generally peaceful nature of pastafarians, I suggest we employ modern technology for the task. By utilising <a href="http://www.lordsandknights.com">games like this</a> we can be responsible for the senseless massacre of millions of (albeit virtual) people within days, rather than the months and years those others needed.</p>

<p><strong>So heed my call and letâ€™s take this thing to the next level. Pastafarians of the world divide!</strong></p>
