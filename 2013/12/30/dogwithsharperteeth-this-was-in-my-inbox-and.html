  <p>This was in my inbox, and I’m guessing it was sent via the submission thingy. I just opened that up recently.</p>

  <p>I love it, first of all. Second, I think I know who it’s from, but it gives no submitter info on my phone. Will you tell me if you sent this lovely thing to me?</p>

<p><strong>Death Announcement</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Sigmund Suitzer, royal empirial judicial councilor, and Mrs. Therese Blum announce in their own name as well as those of all nieces and neffews in deepest sorrow the news of the death of his beloved sister (and aunt)</p>

<p><strong>Babette Beer</strong><br />
<em>widow of a royal empirial professor and gubernatorial councilor</em></p>

<p>who on Friday the 27th of February 1885 at 3 o’clock in the afternoon after lengthy suffering in her 75th year slipped from life into eternal peace. The funeral will take place on Sunday the 1st of March in the morning at half past 9 at the mourning house at Pillersdorfgasse 6 (11th district), just past the central cemetery (Israelite section).</p>

<p><em>this is instead of distinct personal notification</em></p>

<hr />

<p>—-</p>

<p>And yes the whole thing is basically one single sentence with innumerable sub-clauses. But it’s gorgeous.</p>

<p>P.S.: royal and empirial whatever is an honorary title achieved by doing any job long enough, and not an actual role.</p>

<p>P.P.S.: these people obviously lived in Vienna, Austria at a time before WWI when antisemitism was less pronounced than at any later time.</p>
