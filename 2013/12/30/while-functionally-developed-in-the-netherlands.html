        <p>While functionally developed in the Netherlands, the most iconic boomboxes were created in Japan during the 1970s and ‚Äô80s. This was a time when Japanese design and manufacturing was evolving from a copying culture to an innovating culture, and the boombox is a great example of this. I want to find the inventors of these important ‚Äúgrail‚Äù boxes and tell the stories of how they designed the machines we love, before it‚Äôs too late.</p>

<p><strong>‚Äúmachines we love‚Äù?</strong> maybe I‚Äôm becoming an old curmudgeon, but until people develop a taste for music (i.e. adopt mine üòâ ) I‚Äôd rather they listen to their music with headphones. So Boom-Boxes are definitely <strong>not machines I love!</strong></p>
