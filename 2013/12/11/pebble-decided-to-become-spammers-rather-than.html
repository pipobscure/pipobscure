<p>I have just received an e-mail from <a href="https://getpebble.com">Pebble</a> (their Pebble-Info list) and am really disappointed in them as a company.</p>

<p>I backed them during their Kickstater project. The Pebble-Info newsletters have so far always been about directly Pebble related products, such as new apps or watch-faces. Today’s email however promoted all kinds of junk from third parties. It’s obvious, that they have sold out and are now sending spam to their subscribers.</p>

<p>And that makes me really disappointed in them as a company. They should focus on their core strengths (awesome products) rather than sell out their customers.</p>
