<p>… and it’s resolution time. And honestly I think new years resolutions are a huge stupid idea. You might as well call them a list of things i won’t do.</p>

<p>In 2012 I decided I wanted to loose some weight. Started to alter my lifestyle and am now living ultra-low-carb and lost 40kg. No resolution involved.</p>

<p>In 2013 I decided to kick a 20 year 2 pack a day smoking habit. I have smoked my last cigarette on August 9th. Again no resolution involved.</p>

<p>So you see, you can do things and accomplish things and never follow a new years resolution. On the other hand you can make resolutions for every new years of your life and never accomplish anything.</p>

<p>So what’s my point? I am making a new years resolution, one that I’m actually likely to ignore just like all the others. I resolve to never again make a new years resolution.</p>
