    <title>Zuckerberg will simply have that happen. And he’ll hold his head up and stand by his words and deeds. And maybe then will the rest of us learn to forget about this fanciful illusion called privacy.</title>

  <p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is one of the biggest proponents of living more and more of your life in the public, and a new website is ensuring that Zuckerberg himself does just that. On Friday, researchers from the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee launched The Zuckerberg Files, a scholarly website dedicated to collecting every word that Zuckerberg has ever publicly spoken. The intent isn’t to follow him around, but rather to collect interviews, statements, talks, and presentations that he’s made, and then to create transcripts of every one of them. </p>

<p>Which will lead to a prime example of why you act and speak in a thoughtful manner.</p>

<p>Old rule: “Always speak and act in a way, that if it became the front-page of the paper you could hold your head up and stand by your words and deeds”</p>

<p>Zuckerberg will simply have that happen. And he’ll hold his head up and stand by his words and deeds. And maybe then will the rest of us learn to forget about this fanciful illusion called privacy.</p>
