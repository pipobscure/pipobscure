        <p>Nearly a hundred years ago it was realized that statutes were necessary to address two groups of people who could not be counted on to have self control. In 1914 Congress passed the Harrison Narcotics Act which ended addicts’ unrestricted access to drugs, and in 1917 the Second Liberty Bond Act which ended Congress’s unrestricted access to borrowing money. A century later, some things don’t seem to have changed tremendously.</p>
