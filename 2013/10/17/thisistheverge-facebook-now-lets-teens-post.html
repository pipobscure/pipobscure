  <p>Facebook has just announced that it will now allow users under 18 to post publicly. Until today, users aged 17 and under could only post updates that their friends, or in some cases, friends of friends, could see — ostensibly because it helped protect them. The feature likely won’t entice any Facebook-loathing teens into using the service, but creates a level playing field where there wasn’t one before. Now all users will see the same drop-down “audience selector,” which lets you specify who can see each photo or status you post. </p>

<p>Maybe we will finally realise that <a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/53ea514c9ec0">teens know a lot about privacy</a> and we can finally start having a good think about what we actually want to and need to protect children from.</p>

<p>Hint: it’s not what current policy-makers think!</p>

<p>Good that facebook got over it, but i still won’t use it and <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/1/4049592/the-age-of-the-brag-is-over-why-facebook-might-be-losing-teens">neither it seems will a lot of teens</a>. Go figure; I must be young at heart ;)</p>
