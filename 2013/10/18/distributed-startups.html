<p>Shanley wrote an interesting article on <a href="https://medium.com/about-work/c0715b8a7c93">Downfalls of Distributed Startups</a>. I have done distributed and I am currently doing all in one place. There are problems with either and the debate around distributed teams is finally getting to a point where it gets from fanboyism to an actual intellectual debate.</p>

<p>My experience with distributed teams has been great. When you have all members of a team working from different locations and interacting exclusively online things work really well. There is one big caveat however; the moment there is a location that routinely contains more than one person, the team falls apart.</p>

<p>So the real problem with distributed teams in my view is that it’s an all or nothing proposal. Either you go all in or you leave it be.</p>

<p>Now that doesn’t mean that localised teams are the answer to efficient work. Localised teams have the problem that all this direct interaction causes a lot of distraction, a lot of interruption. I have found that if you have room of developers working on a project they tend to be less efficient because of these interruptions.</p>

<p>The model that I have come to believe is optimal is to have a fully distributed team, that travels to a common location every few months. This picks up some of the advantages of localised teams while keeping the advantages of distributed teams.</p>
