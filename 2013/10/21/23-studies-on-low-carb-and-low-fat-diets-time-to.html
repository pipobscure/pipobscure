<blockquote>
  <p>Over 20 studies have compared low-carb and low-fat diets. Low-carb diets consistently lead to better results, both for weight loss and common risk factors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didnâ€™t do a studdy, but empirically I have been living ultra low carb with regular medical checks for 12+ months now.</p>

<p>I lost around 40 kg and am the fittest I have been since puberty. My blood levels are right where the text-books want them. I am doing things that would have given me a cardiac episode a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>I basically live of fat and proteins with almost 0 carbs. So just from personal experience I call BS on low-carb diets being bad for you.</p>
