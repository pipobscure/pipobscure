    <h1>Life is like a game of poker</h1>
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I am not really into gambling. The most I have ever gambled was playing poker for gummy-bears. But this year like does feel like a game of poker, or at least how I imagine it feeling.</p>

<p>For years I have been talking of leaving the country and moving somewhere else. This spring life dealt me a hand that allowed me to go for it. It looked hard into my eyes and said:</p>

<p><strong>“I think you have been bluffing”</strong></p>

<p>Well now we had to make a choice and we showed our hand. Well we are winning that game. I found a job in London. The last two weeks we were there to find a place to live, a school for the kids, and do a lot the administrative tasks.</p>

<p>London treated us like a charm. A city is so different when you are there with a view toward staying. And then our time was up. It was back to Austria for a week before going on our holiday to the US that we had planned/booked for like a year.</p>

<p>Being in London felt like winning that game of poker. I could almost feel the chips on my arms as I proverbially shovelled them toward me with every step in setting up life there. Leaving London felt awful, because I had to give all those chips back to the croupier, watching lovingly as they go back to the office.</p>

<p>No I’m just sitting here, waiting for them to come out with the actual winnings. <strong>I so can’t wait to go back and actually live there!</strong></p>
