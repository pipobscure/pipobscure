    <title>Well of course it’s fire-proof: it’s an integral part of protecting the legs as well as part of the steering system. By using the legs to shape the cloth that in turns shapes the air-stream from the rockets. And that’s how you steer. That dress is not just pretty, it’ the perfect rocketeering outfit as well.</title>

  <p><strong>I do hope that gorgeous dress is made of fireproof material as when those rockets fire up it will be well within singing range.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Winged Warrier says “</strong>**Another shot of the back of my costume, this one taken at Salt Lake Comic Con. You can also see the back of my bustle skirt, made by Damsel in the Dress (she also made my corset ) You can also see my birdcage purse!<br />
The jetpack was so much fun to make! The wings are resined craft foam with cardboard on the top. The ‘jetpack’ is 3 liter bottles with craft foam, a vent cover, funnels, phone cords, hair perming tubes, thumbtacks and MORE!”</p>
