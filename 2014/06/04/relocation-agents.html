    <h1>Relocation Agents</h1>
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>It’s absolutely bizarre. I have these relocation agents supposedly helping me. They claim to be helping with house hunting. I told them that I am moving a family of 4 people and I told them my housing budget.</p>

<p>One would expect, that the reaction is a statement about possible areas to move to. What I got instead was a list of the 10 most expensive areas in London and the statement that I might not want to look for a 3 bedroom place there but rather for a 1 bedroom.</p>

<p>My head was like: do we need to practice basic listening comprehension? Hello, family of <strong>4</strong> not going to happen with a <strong>1</strong> bedroom. After all, I actually still love my wife and am not playing golf yet.</p>

<p>So I specifically ask: “OK, since you know London better than me, maybe you could suggest some areas, that will fit both my budgetary and space needs”. Which is definitely possible, since my rental budget is roughly the national average gross salary, and there are potential properties to be found via zoopla.co.uk</p>

<p>Any case. They said they’d research that. Now I just received another document from them, which gives a “Market Overview” of ???</p>

<p>You guessed it! <strong>The 10 most expensive areas of London</strong>!</p>

<p>So I guess it’ll be up to me actually research and locate a place to live. I have no idea yet what the point of that relocation service then really is, but I am determined to find out. I am pretty sure, that they do actually provide something of value, I just don’t quite know what yet.</p>
