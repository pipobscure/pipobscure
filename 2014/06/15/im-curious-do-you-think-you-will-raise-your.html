        <!-- <p>*Question: *im curious do you think you will raise your children as vegetarians?</p>

<p>*Answer: *This is one of those controversial questions that shouldn’t be controversial hahaha I don’t know i won’t be having children for a good few years hahaha</p>

<p>Ideally i would love an entire vegan family haha but i probably will and once they’re old enough they can decide for themselves whether they want to eat meat, i’m not sure i’d feel comfortable choosing to raise my child on something i don’t believe in.. also they’ll be feeding from a vegetarian/vegan body so their digestive system probably wouldn’t do well with changing onto meat anyway but as i said i’ll be open if they do want to eat meat. It’s not something i’ll be needing to think about any time soon though hahaha</p>
