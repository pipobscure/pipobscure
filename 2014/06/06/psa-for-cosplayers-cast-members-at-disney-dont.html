  <p>I’m a cast member (employee) at one of the US Disney Parks. Every year when the local anime conventions come into town we have a problem. Cosplayers love to come to the park and try to cosplay in the park.</p>

  <p>WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS.<br />
WE DO NOT ALLOW ANYONE OVER THE AGE OF 10 IN…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, this is so wrong I don’t quite know where to begin:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>You cannot allow this?</em><br />
Well actually you could if you wanted to, but you don’t so you won’t. But don’t you dare to tell people you cannot!</li>
  <li>Intellectual Property is not the reason!<br />
Because you do not own it!. As a matter of fact many characters like “Sleeping Beauty” or “Pocahontas” are in the public domain. What Disney does own id the copyright to the specific expression of that character as portrayed in film and merchandise. No cosplayer could even aspire to be so real (i.e. 2 dimensional) as to infringe on Disney copyright, which leaves trademarks, but those are about brand confusion and require there to be a competing and mistakable product.</li>
  <li>It’s for the kids?<br />
Really, because a kid following someone around in an amusement park where there are security people and cameras covering every inch is really more of a problem than some jerk arresting “Belle”?</li>
  <li>Your managers have started arresting people?<br />
Your f***ing managers cannot arrest anyone. The most they can do is ask someone to leave Disney property. That’s it. No arrests or anything of the like involved.</li>
  <li>Just because you portray a Disney character in a park, does not make you a moral authority of any kind.<br />
As a matter of fact, I am asserting, that the Disney policy to disallow anyone over the age of 10 in costume is wrong. In my eyes it’s actually reprehensible.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>PSA for Disney: Disallowing Cosplayers at Parks. Don’t think you’re awesome</strong></p>

<p>P.S.: Just if you are wondering: I am not into cosplaying myself but I do enjoy watching people do so.</p>
