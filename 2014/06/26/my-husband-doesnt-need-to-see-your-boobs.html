<p>This is likely the stupidest thing I have read in a while. If that woman is so insecure about herself and her relationship, that she feels threatened by social-media pictures of women living their lives including hanging out at the beach; well guess what her problem is not the women at the beach, it’s her insecurity and self doubt.</p>

<p>Yet her fears are real. She should definitely seek professional help rather than trying to curb other peoples joy in life.</p>
