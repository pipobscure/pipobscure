    <h1>The joys of a moving Sunday</h1>
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>After getting the Virgin Media stuff sorted, today is going to be painfully busy. First there is a whole lot of shopping to do …</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bath Mats</li>
  <li>Bathroom Cabinets</li>
  <li>Laundry Hampers</li>
  <li>Printer Paper</li>
  <li>stuff I didn’t even know one could need</li>
</ul>

<p>… and after that it’s finally time to actually unpack our clothing and other stuff. So I guess we’ll be spending the afternoon deep in the wardrobes that we set up yesterday trying to restore order to our habitat.</p>

<p>And then for the first time in over 10 years we will own a TV, which is supposed to be delivered today. And on Tuesday I’m expecting delivery of one of our new sofas. After that will be the first time one could reasonably claim that we have moved in.</p>

<p>Yesterday we also met our neighbours to one side. They have only been living here since April, have 2 kids aged 13 &amp; 16, and seem really nice. Except we won’t actually get together until they return from holidays in 10 days time.</p>

<p>Oh and other important stuff we did already is getting home insurance, registering with a GP (doctor) and getting library cards for everyone. Interestingly, the library cards are what gives you access to all other facilities in the borough as well. So we’ll need them for the pool and stuff too.</p>

<p>Well off to work, it’ll be a busy day!</p>
