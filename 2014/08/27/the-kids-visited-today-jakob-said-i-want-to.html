        <p>The kids visited today. Jakob said: “I want to work here some day. How do I do that?”</p>

<p>I told him learning English is a good first step. And then he has to study a lot and learn as much as possible.</p>

<p>I think this was the first time he understood what I was saying when I told him: “We are moving to London, to make sure you have as many chances in your future as possible.”</p>

<p>It was good to see him excited about being here.</p>
