I love colourful mental images. Especially when they make unwitting statements about the speaker like Nr.3</p>

<p>With magnetism like poles repulse, so if he likened looks to magnetism he also made a statement about himself.</p>

<p>But I think he was onto something. If beauty were like magnetism, then would that not mean it depends entirely on the observer?</p>

<p>Keep thinking about it and you might come to a place where beauty is not at all objective, but simply a reflection of an observers needs. Which in turn explains why unless you realise that beauty is subjective, you will never like your own.</p>

<p>After all, you are repulsed by like poles.</p>
