  <p>I hate when people say money doesn’t buy you happiness. it does. it buys you financial stability, a nice house, nice cars, nice vacations and trips, healthier food, a better education, etc. like wearing burberry while driving around in an audi would probably make me pretty happy too. but it’s just that rich people often take their comfortable lives for granted and end up being spoiled and ungrateful for what they have </p>

<p>Money doesn’t buy you happiness, but it does relieve you of a lot of existential angst. That in turn leaves you free to pursue happiness. So while money is not a guarantee for happiness (i.e. buys it), it does make it a lot easier to attain.</p>
