      <p>i did a fasted cardio. actually 1.5 mi of HIIT, but had to stop midway bc unlaced sneakerz.</p>

      <p>then broke a 16 hr fast w flax muffin w kgold, my new favorite cheese, and a quest bar.</p>

      <p>is this how you cut?</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>did you read the label. “tastes like real aged cheddar with a hint of Parmesan” and “no difference between milk from growth hormone treated cows and no hormone treated cows”</p>

    <p>I mean while all of that might be true, it doesn’t really sound all that appetising. I think I’ll stick with real cheddar from real grassfed cows.</p>

  <p>cool u do u bro</p>

  <p>i did read the label, and it says that the cheese is made from milk NOT treated with rBST. the disclaimer is required by the FDA to be put on all dairy products that do not contain rBST.</p>

  <p>i also eat grain-fed beef and caged chickens and don’t buy organic produce/anything ever or cage-free eggs most of the time. sorry?</p>

<p>Hey you go and eat whatever you fancy. Just go for it and never apologise for what you like. Especially not to an old geezer like me.</p>

<p>All I was saying is that the label makes it not appeal to me. Cheers!
