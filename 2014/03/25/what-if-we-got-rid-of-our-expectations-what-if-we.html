        <!-- <p>What if we got rid of our expectations? What if we said, “Food doesn’t need to taste like anything. Let’s see what this tastes like.”</p>

<p>I heard tell of a wine expert who wanted to develop his palate, and so he would taste all kinds of things. Even dirt. Put dirt in his mouth, and see what it tastes like. Most people would be grossed out about it, but what if you just wanted to find out?</p>

<p>Be curious. Explore the taste of foods. Let go of expectations and prejudgements. You might find out some interesting things. And by the way: this works with everything in life, not just food.</p>
