  <p><strong>Ari LeVaux: How is it that, in your opinion, glyphosate causes gluten sensitivity?</strong></p>

  <p>Stephanie Seneff: What we argued in the paper is that glyphosate binds to the gluten. Gluten usually forms cross-mesh connections between different amino acids, and glyphosate would disrupt that because it would prevent the cross-mesh by binding to the gluten and causing the gluten to stay in the form that is known to be more allergenic. So we believe glyphosate causes the gluten to assume the form that is more allergenic.</p>

  <p><strong>**ALV:</strong> Your paper discusses the reason that glyphosate is being sprayed onto wheat. Could you explain this practice?**</p>

  <p>SS: Glyphosate is being sprayed on wheat right before the harvest. This has become a more and more popular practice among farmers. We found specific data in the UK showing a dramatic increase in the practice of spraying the wheat with glyphosate right before the harvest. This is three or four days before they harvest the seed. You canâ€™t imagine that that glyphosate has disappeared in those three or four days. The intent is to kill the plant.</p>
