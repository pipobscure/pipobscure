<p>I’ve been rewatching “Being Erica”, a Canadian TV series. It’s basically a story about this totally crazy woman that meets a time-travelling psychoanalyst. She goes back to key points in her life in an attempt to find out how to fix things she regrets. And while that works sometimes, others it doesn’t quite work as well.</p>

<p>It’s the stereotypical “Chic-TV” and I absolutely love it! Of course that might be because it is an inspiration to reflect about how to get a grip on my own life.</p>

<p>Any case, this is the theme-song for the series. It’s by Lily Frost whom I discovered due to the series. And have totally fallen in love with. Her music is awesome.</p>

<p>Any case, you should all go listen to some Lily Frost. And when she has gotten into the mood, reflect a bit on your life and realise that it’s pretty amazing. Now what are you going to make of it? I for one will throw myself into it and enjoy the hell out of it!</p>
