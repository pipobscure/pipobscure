<blockquote>
  <p>Dear Cutie-Pie,</p>

  <p>Recently, your mother and I were searching for an answer on Google. Halfway through entering the question, Google returned a list of the most popular searches in the world. Perched at the top of the list was “How to keep him interested.”</p>

  <p>It startled me. I scanned several of the countless articles about how to be sexy and sexual, when to bring him a beer versus a sandwich, and the ways to make him feel smart and superior.</p>

  <p>And I got <em>angry</em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Little One, it <em>is</em> not, has never <em>been</em>, and never <em>will</em> be your job to “keep him interested.”</strong></p>

  <p>Little One, your only task is to know deeply in your soul—in that unshakeable place that isn’t rattled by rejection and loss and ego—that you are <em>worthy</em> of interest. (If you can remember that everyone <em>else</em> is worthy of interest also, the battle of your life will be mostly won. But that is a letter for another day.)</p>

  <p>If you can trust your worth in this way, you will be attractive in the most important sense of the word: you will attract a boy who is both <em>capable</em> of interest and who wants to spend his one life investing all of his interest in <em>you</em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Little One, I want to tell you about the boy who doesn’t need to be <em>kept_interested, because he knows you _are interesting:</em></strong></p>

  <p>I don’t care if he puts his elbows on the dinner table—as long as he puts his eyes on the way your nose scrunches when you smile. And then can’t stop looking.</p>

  <p>I don’t care if he can’t play a bit of golf with me—as long as he can play with the children you give him and revel in all the glorious and frustrating ways they are just like you.</p>

  <p>I don’t care if he doesn’t follow his wallet—as long as he follows his <em>heart</em> and it always leads him back to you.</p>

  <p>I don’t care if he is strong—as long as he gives you the space to exercise the strength that is in <em>your</em> heart.</p>

  <p>I couldn’t care less how he votes—as long as he wakes up every morning and daily elects you to a place of honor in your home and a place of reverence in <em>his</em> heart.</p>

  <p>I don’t care about the color of his skin—as long as he paints the canvas of your lives with brushstrokes of patience, and sacrifice, and vulnerability, and tenderness.</p>

  <p>I don’t care if he was raised in <em>this</em> religion or <em>that</em> religion or <em>no</em> religion—as long as he was raised to value the sacred and to know every moment of life, and every moment of life with you, is <em>deeply</em> sacred.</p>

  <p>In the end, Little One, if you stumble across a man like that and he and I have nothing else in common, we will have the <em>most important</em> thing in common:</p>

  <p><em>You.</em></p>

  <p><strong>Because in the end, Little One, the only thing you should have to do to “keep him interested” is to be <em>you</em>.</strong></p>

  <p>Your eternally interested guy,</p>

  <p>Daddy</p>

  <p><strong>Happy International Women’s Day</strong></p>
