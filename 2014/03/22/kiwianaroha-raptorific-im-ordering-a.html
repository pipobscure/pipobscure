    <title>Yeah there are jerks out there that think it’s ok to disregard women and their rights. There are people out there that think “raping and pillaging” is just “boys being boys”. That needs to be called out, but you can go overboard and “pour out the baby with the bathwater”. And that is something we really need to learn to avoid.</title>

    <p>I’m ordering a nuclear strike on the “Friend Zone” so we can be rid of “Nice Guys” once and for all.</p>

  <p>“Hey fellows, don’t you hate it when women exercise their right to say ‘no’ to you?” is what I got from the facebook status. I’m glad it ticked off someone enough to write the comment below it.</p>

<p>Actually fellows I do hate that. The you go and risk your heart and are turned down and given the impression, that it’s a general disinclination rather than you personally. Then shortly thereafter it is clearly demonstrated that it was in fact you personally. You would be a total ass not to be affected.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing: Yeah the woman just made use of her right to decline a relationship. Fine, noone faults her for it, even Peter. He said: “… don’t you hate it when that happens…” not “… I hate these bitches that do this to me…”</p>

<p>I can hate something emotionally negative happening to me or someone else and still think it’s ok that it’s happening. To still think there was nothing wrong with how people acted, not even Peter.</p>

<p>His feelings were hurt and he talked about it. He didn’t blame anyone else for it; he didn’t claim that it was unfair or wrong. All he said is state what he felt and for that he is getting put down.</p>
