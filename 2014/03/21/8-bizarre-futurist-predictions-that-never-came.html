<ol>
  <li>Say goodbye to the letters C, X and Q<br />
Well we still have those, but the predicted “spelling by sound” and “shortening of words” has actually happened <em>LOL</em></li>
  <li>Flying bicycles mean empty cities<br />
Well we don’t have flying bicycles, but the real prediction was that there was ubiquitous personal transportation. And that has occurred. Everyone has a car, a lot of people have moved out of the cities and some cities like London or San Francisco are becoming so expensive that the are “reserved for business”</li>
  <li>Everything will be coated in plastic, and food comes in frozen bricks<br />
While the details of the cleanup process aren’t there (yet?), everthing is covered in plastic.</li>
  <li>3D television, complete with “smellevision”<br />
We do have 3D TVs and we found that we really don’t want <em>smellevision</em> because really acting is a sweaty business.</li>
  <li>Space travel for all<br />
Not quite yet “for all”, but we are getting there.</li>
  <li>Underground homes, with automated kitchens<br />
“Men will continue to withdraw from nature in order to create an environment that will suit them better” as if that isn’t spot on.</li>
  <li>Communal showers for hippie homes<br />
All I have to say is <em>fitness club</em>.</li>
  <li>Colonies on the moon, of course<br />
Well this one ain’t happening yet. Like no progress.</li>
</ol>

<p>I for one think that 7/8 isn’t a list of “False Predictions”</p>
