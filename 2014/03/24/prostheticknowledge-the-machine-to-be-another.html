  <p><strong>The Machine To Be Another - Gender Swap</strong></p>

  <p>Art + tech experiment where particpants view themselves in the body of their opposite sex using a camera mounted Oculus Rift each - video embedded below [features nudity]:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Gender Swap is an experiment that uses <a href="http://www.themachinetobeanother.org/">themachinetobeanother.org/</a> system as a platform for embodiment experience (a neuroscience technique in which users can feell themselves like if they were in a different body). In order to create the brain ilusion we use the immersive Head Mounted Display Oculus Rift, and first-person cameras. To create this perception, both users have to syncronize their movements. If one does not correspond to the movement of the other, the embodiment experience does not work. It means that both users have to constantly agree on every movement they make. Through out this experiment, we aim to investigate issues like Gender Identity, Queer Theory, feminist technoscience, Intimacy and Mutual Respect.</p>
