<blockquote>
  <p>One of the really obvious examples of how things have changed since my appearance has changed (in that my body is smaller/fitter) and I have apparently entered this realm of being a person viewed as attractive by a large portion of society (or at least larger) is that people learn my name firstâ€¦</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It might not be a factor of your looks directly. I have notices that, independant of optics, self-confident and assertive people get better noticability. So it might just be that your self-image has improved to the extent that your surroundings notice your confidence.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, congratulations.</p>
