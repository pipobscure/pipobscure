        <h1 id="call-center-scripts">Call-Center-Scripts</h1>

<p>Is there a call-center-script that says <strong><em>“If a customer wants to get information on how to give us money, pretend to be a complete nit-wit”</em></strong> ?</p>

<p>If not, I just spoke to the dumbest ever agent. I mean this woman was risking her life speaking to me, because to get the phone to her ear she had to take out the headphones telling her to breathe.</p>

<p>She honestly answered my question on how to purchase an upgraded calling plan with: <strong><em>“Sorry sir, I am not permitted to give out that information due to the data-protection act.”</em></strong></p>

<p>On one hand that make me really want to be their customer, because if they are so worried about data-protection, that they wont tell me how to give them more money, I feel my data is going to be really safe. On the other hand <strong><em>that’s just bloody stupid</em></strong>, which is not an attribute I value in a company that I want to provide me with a complex technological service such as mobile phone service.</p>
