<blockquote>
  <p>the fact that a girl being a feminist is a turn off to a lot of guys is just further proof that sexism exists they’re literally saying they don’t want a girl who requires respect because that’s just no fun </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what’s your point? The fact that it’s raining means there is water in the sky. Big surprise. So what?</p>

<p>Let me tell you something. Most people get exactly the amount of respect from others that they give themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Thing is: that can be both good and bad.</strong></p>

<p>If a woman doesn’t have any respect for herself, she’s more likely to be in an abusive relationship; a woman in an abusive relationship is also less likely to have/gain any respect for herself.</p>

<p><em>On the other hand.</em></p>

<p>A woman that is self-confident and respects herself (and other women, which happens to be the definition of feminism), is more likely to be in a supportive and respectful relationship. And a woman in a supportive relationship is much more likely to respect herself.</p>

<p>So rather than spout quaint deprecatory snark, maybe it’s time to realise that you get what you ask for. If you ask all shy and scared: “Honey would it turn you off if labeled myself a feminist?” and then be surprised if he says yes it may just be time to realise that for every man out there that finds feminism a turn off, there are two dozen that find a strong self-respecting female partner the biggest turn on there is. So rather than being self deprecatory and at the same time complain about douche-bags, maybe realise that likely as not you are right just the way you are and assert that. Then maybe you don’t have to yammer as much.</p>
