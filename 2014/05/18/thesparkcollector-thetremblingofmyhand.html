      <p>I have never said what the fuck more to any single post in the history of tumblr,</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>More like died of people who went way over board in the name of religion. I’m not religious but I have enough respect it to not blame religion for murders, child abuse, or war. Very few religions include values based on hatred and violence. Religion doesn’t start wars or kill children, people do.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I understand the spirit of what thrembingofmyhand is saying here, but having lived under the influence of a cult, it’s hard for me to say that religion is not to blame.</p>

  <p>No, religion <em>in general</em> doesn’t have to be harmful, but these people most likely felt incredible pressure to deal with these illnesses, etc, the way their religious leaders preached they should.</p>

  <p>People can, theoretically, choose to buck their religion and do what is objectively right by their children, but the power of brainwashing is often underrated in these situations. When you’ve spent your whole life being told that something (blood transfusions, for example) will damn you to eternal darkness, it becomes out of your reach to simply stop believing it.</p>

  <p>So yes, I agree that people, not religion, are the problem here, but I think it’s worth noting that most the typical laymen in these religions are at the mercy of the corruption and psychological manipulation of their evil leaders.</p>

<p>No actually religions are inherently dangerous. Freedom of religion needs to have much stricter limits.</p>

<p>As an adult I can drink, but when I do I am not allowed to drive because it endangers others.</p>

<p>As an adult I can believe, but when I do I should not be allowed to make decisions that affect others lives.
