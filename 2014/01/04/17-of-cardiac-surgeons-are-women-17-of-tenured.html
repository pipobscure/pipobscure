    <h1>17 of cardiac surgeons are women 17 of tenured</h1>
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>17% of cardiac surgeons are women, 17% of tenured professors are women. It just goes on and on. And isn’t that strange that that’s also the percentage of women in crowd scenes in movies? What if we’re actually training people to see that ratio as normal so that when you’re an adult, you don’t notice?</p>

<p>…We just heard a fascinating and disturbing study where they looked at the ratio of men and women in groups. And they found that if there’s 17% women, the men in the group think it’s 50-50. And if there’s 33% women, the men perceive that as there being more women in the room than men.</p>

<p>Seriously, go listen to this.</p>

<p>Interesting.</p>

<p>That means if the ratio is actually 50:50 it feels like 80:20 to men? Sounds about right.</p>
