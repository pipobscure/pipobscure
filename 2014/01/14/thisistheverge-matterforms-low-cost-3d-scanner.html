    <title>> 3D printers are becoming more and more accessible, but there’s still one big hurdle to using them: unless you know how to create digital objects, there’s not much to print. But Matterform is aiming to change that with its stylish, simple, and fairly inexpensive 3D scanner. After a successful Indiegogo campaign last spring, Matterform is finally preparing to launch the device next month, and it’s unveiling the final model at CES this week.</title>
