        <!-- <p>Ten rape prevention tips:</p>

<p>1. Don’t put drugs in women’s drinks.</p>

<p>2. When you see a woman walking by herself, leave her alone.</p>

<p>3. If you pull over to help a woman whose car has broken down, remember not to rape her.</p>

<p>4. If you are in an elevator and a woman gets in, don’t rape her.</p>

<p>5. When you encounter a woman who is asleep, the safest course of action is to not rape her.</p>

<p>6. Never creep into a woman’s home through an unlocked door or window, or spring out at her from between parked cars, or rape her.</p>

<p>7. Remember, people go to the laundry room to do their laundry. Do not attempt to molest someone who is alone in a laundry room.</p>

<p>8. Use the Buddy System! If it is inconvenient for you to stop yourself from raping women, ask a trusted friend to accompany you at all times.</p>

<p>9. Carry a rape whistle. If you find that you are about to rape someone, blow the whistle until someone comes to stop you.</p>

<p>10. Don’t forget: Honesty is the best policy. When asking a woman out on a date, don’t pretend that you are interested in her as a person; tell her straight up that you expect to be raping her later. If you don’t communicate your intentions, the woman may take it as a sign that you do not plan to rape her.</p>
