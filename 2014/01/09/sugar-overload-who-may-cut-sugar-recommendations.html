  <blockquote>
    <p>The World Health Organization is considering cutting the amount of sugar it recommends in your daily diet to half the current limit. Experts are proposing cutting the recommended level that people should consume from no more than 10 percent of their calories from sugar to no more than five percent, based on fears of heart disease, obesity, and tooth decay, The Sunday Times in the UK reports. “It is political dynamite,” said Philip James, president of the WHO-affiliated International Association for the Study of Obesity, in the report. “I would agree with the recommendation to reduce it to five percent,” added Shrinath Reddy, a cardiologist and a member of the WHO panel of experts.</p>
