        <p>*Question: *How many weeks have you been doing keto and how many pounds have you lost so far? Would you recommend it to someone wanting to drop 30lbs in 3 months?</p>

<p>*Answer: *8 weeks &amp; I’ve dropped 24lbs!<br />
It’s different for everyone! Don’t go into it expecting to have the same loss as me, my body went into shock I think &amp; I’m really anal about it as well!<br />
I never go over my carb limit!</p>
