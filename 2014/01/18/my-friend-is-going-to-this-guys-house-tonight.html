        <!-- <p>*Question: *my friend is going to this guys house tonight. He’s like 21 and she’s 16 but she told him she was 19. Her parents think she’s staying at one of our other friends house. I’m worried about her because she met him like 1 time before now and she just sent me a picture of a bottle of vodka that she’s taking with her. I tried to tell her to be careful but she’s so naive that it’s not working. What do I do? She won’t listen to me or my other friends.</p>

<p>*Answer: *He could be a good guy or whatever but that’s still really dangerous.</p>

<p>As a friend you really need to try and stop her (yeah everything could be okay but there’s massive room for error here). Chances are that guy wouldn’t agree to see her if he knew her real age. </p>

<p>I don’t know how to help you sorry. Telling her parents will result in her blaming you. And you’ve already tried to stop her. Maybe get some of your other friends to try? Or one of you can go with her, and cockblock if that’s his intention. Or you could text him and tell him her real age. I don’t know sorry.</p>
