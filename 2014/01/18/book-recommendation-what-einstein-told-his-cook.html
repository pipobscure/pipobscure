<p>Well you learn that your scientists and commedians have two very distinct skillsets that never unite in one person. Mr. Wolke is an excellent scientist and while his puns fall flat really badly, the overall book is pretty awesome. You learn a lot about the kitchen and food. He is not (and states so) a nutritionist, but he is very good at explaining how this food stuff works. So if you are into food and food prep, this is a good start for understanding your kitchen.</p>
