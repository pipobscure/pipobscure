    <p>JUST RAN 7KM WITHOUT WALKING! IM SO EXCITED RIGHT NOW! It took me ten minutes longer than the average person, but I don’t care! I did it I did it!! I’m so so proud of myself, it felt so so good! I’m sure that if I do it twice more, it’ll be so much easier to go further :)</p>

    <p>Happy days!</p>

  <p>Hell yeah, get it, girl! Who cares about the average person, what matters is you went the distance. You were better than you were before, and that’s something to be damn proud of! ♥</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a lie!</p>

<p>The average person never runs 7k without walking. So the time it takes an average person to run 7k is infinite. It did not take you infinity plus 10 minutes to run 7k, because you actually have completed the run already.</p>

<p>Therefore you have lied!</p>

<p>Don’t lie again, you are obviously better than that ;)</p>
