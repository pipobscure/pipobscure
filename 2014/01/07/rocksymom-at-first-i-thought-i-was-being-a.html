    <title>They don’t do cursive until 7th grade? Here in Austria they learn the alphabet in first grade and start cursive in second. Wow, that explains why printing is so popular in the US (when I went to high school in NY I was pretty much the only one writing in cursive)</title>

  <p>At first I thought I was being a pioneer in childhood development but apparently loads of other kids with SPD and fine motor coordination issues do better at cursive than print.</p>

  <p>Just another example of why I’m so glad to homeschool, cursive will not be taught in the public schools AT ALL until maybe 7th grade. My son’s printing is barely legible and trying to correct him is torture for us both. Starting over with new instructions seems to be a happy place.</p>
