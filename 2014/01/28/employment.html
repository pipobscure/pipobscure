<p>…the thing I no longer have.</p>

<p>Well, it is the end of an era for me. I have been working on <a href="https://durchblicker.at">this price comparison site</a> for the last four years. From today on that is no longer the case. The company now has different needs: development of new features and technological mastery is now no longer the main focus. Now it needs more of an IT manager.</p>

<p>While I am really sad that it’s over, I am also glad. It frees me to do new things. Who knows what will come next.</p>

<p>Any case, if you know of a good challenge anywhere, tell me. I think I might even be up for moving to another country. Any case exciting times ahead.</p>
