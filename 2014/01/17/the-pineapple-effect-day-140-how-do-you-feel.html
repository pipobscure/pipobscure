<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Day 140:</strong> how do you feel about people disrespecting their parents?<br />
I feel like a lot of people don’t appreciate their parents enough, but there are definitely some parents who treat their kids like shit and don’t deserve any respect. I feel really bad for people who still respect (or try to respect) their abusive parents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should become a politician. This was a perfect politician answer:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Repeat the statement of the question (there are people disrespecting their parents)</li>
  <li>Switch topics by making a loosley related statement (some parents abuse their kids)</li>
  <li>Give a quanswer (question framed as an answer) about your own statement (I don’t get kids respecting their abusive parents)</li>
</ol>

<p>And presto, question has been evaded without an answer. However, since you are not in a political forum, here you can be called on it. So start again:</p>

<p><em>How do you feel about people disrespecting their parents?</em></p>
