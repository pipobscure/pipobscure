      <blockquote>
        <p>i really hate seeing children at gay rallies. in most cases, they don’t understand what they’re doing and what they’re promoting. i think most children are pressured into going to gay rallies by their parents and, therefore, pressured into believing in gay marriage. </p>

      <p><em>Excuse you</em>, I knew about homosexuality since I was <em>four</em>. With five years I could already argue about it and with six I had a formed opinion. All my mother<strong>S</strong> did was explain to me what it was, without ever telling me if it was good of bad.</p>

      <p>The truth is that is actually easier for kids to understand homosexuality, and maybe even accept it, if they are told about it at a young age.  </p>

      <p>Yes, maybe the two-years-old kids there are not sure of whats going on, but their parents are raising them to open their minds and accept differences without it being a huge deal.</p>

      <p>It’s funny how people don’t mind dragging kids at sundays to the church, to make them sit and listen to things they can’t understand nor question, but it’s so wrong to take them to a walk were they can see pretty rainbows , and later understand what they mean.</p>

      <p>This is bullshit.</p>
