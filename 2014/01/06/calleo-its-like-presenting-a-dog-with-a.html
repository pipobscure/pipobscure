<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s like presenting a dog with a sirloin steak and expecting him not to eat it.”</p>

  <p>Well.</p>

  <p>I presented my two dogs with an actual sirloin steak, then told them no.</p>

  <p>Woofles didn’t even approach it when I set it down, as I hadn’t told him it was okay to do so.<br />
Quinn approached it, completely ready to take it from the plate (as her manners are not yet as good as Woofles’ manners), was told no, and immediately backed off.</p>

  <p>When Woofles heard the no, he turned away as well because he knew that steak was not for him to eat.</p>

  <p><strong>Notice how they didn’t ‘argue’, didn’t take it anyway, didn’t get aggressive, didn’t beg, or didn’t try to somehow persuade me that they should be able to have it.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>They were told no, they backed off.</strong></p>

  <p>So, essentially, if you use that analogy to excuse rape, you’re saying you have <em>less</em> self control and <em>fewer</em> basic social manners than my two dogs.</p>

  <p>That also probably means you should be neutered and kept on a leash.</p>
