        <p>Dear men,</p>

        <p>underwear is sexy and expensive, please make an effort to appreciate it more instead of rushing to take it off and throwing it on the floor</p>

        <p>thank you x</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Yes, but the real cherished present is inside. You can’t blame little boys for wanting to get…</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Seems the real problem is “shitty rushed sex”. If it was an incredible multi-orgasmic delectation following you probably wouldn’t mind that ripped bra.</p>

    <p>And no I’m under no illusion that I could deliver so I’m not offering. I’m just wondering why appreciation of “wrapping paper” would make “shitty rushed sex” any better.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>i’m saying that if my bra is being undone before my clothes have even came off then the sex is going to be rushed and therefore probably a shitty one-sided affair, don’t get me wrong if it’s heated in the moment ripping a bra off can be sexy but i’m saying more men need to appreciate it, lingerie is designed to make us feel sexy and for men to be turned on by it, so why aren’t men using it to their advantage and spending some time appreciating that our boobs look great in bras and letting it give them that extra thrill.. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and I’m saying, that men are like little boys: we want our presents. and while I empathize with the feeling, most of us are way too simple to get any extra thrills.</p>

<p>(now I’m being intentionally obstinate. happens when little boys are confronted with the fact that the girl in the conversation is actually right)</p>
