<blockquote>
  <p>Smoking Kid.</p>

  <p>Called by many “the best anti-smoking ad ever,” this campaign filmed children walking up to adult smokers, asking them for a light.</p>

  <p>Every adult took the opportunity to remind the children that smoking was bad and rattled off the health consequences. The children replied, “If it’s so bad, why are you smoking?” before handing them an anti-smoking leaflet.</p>
