    <p>Hear ye, hear ye! The second official selection of the Reblog Book Club has been officially selected! We’ll be reading <a href="http://widgets.penguin.com/Pages/affiliateLanding/index.aspx?isbn=9780670012091">The Impossible Knife of Memory</a> by the amazing <a href="http://lauriehalseanderson.tumblr.com/">Laurie Halse Anderson</a>, author of Speak, Wintergirls, and many more.</p>

    <p>The book comes out on Tuesday, January 7, and we’ll start the book club then. This is your heads up if you’d like to preorder or request it from the library. Email bookclub@tumblr.com with your Tumblr URL if you already know you definitely want to participate.</p>

    <p>It’s a more serious and more difficult book than Fangirl, but we think it’s terrific, and we’ll definitely have a lot to talk about! More about the story: </p>

    <p><em>For the past five years, Hayley Kincaid and her father, Andy, have been on the road, never staying long in one place as he struggles to escape the demons that have tortured him since his return from Iraq. Now they are back in the town where he grew up so Hayley can attend school. Perhaps, for the first time, Hayley can have a normal life, put aside her own painful memories, even have a relationship with Finn, the hot guy who obviously likes her but is hiding secrets of his own.</em></p>

    <p>Keep following this blog for info — More details soon! Looking forward to reading with all of you again!</p>
