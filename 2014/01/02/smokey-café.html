    <h1>Smokey Café</h1>
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Today I placed myself for the first time since August, when I stopped smoking, in a café where I used to do a lot of work. I grabbed my Laptop and started hacking. Throughout the day, the café got smokier and smokier, a fact that I had never previously noticed.</p>

<p>Today it turned so bad that I actually had to leave because I couldn’t breathe anymore. Now I’m wondering: has it always been like that?</p>

<p>Probably yes. So I guess I won’t be going back anytime soon. I can’t believe I was ever able to handle that.</p>
