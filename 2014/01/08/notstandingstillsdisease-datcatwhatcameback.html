          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Pope Francis is People Of The Year by LEADING GAY RIGHTS magazine,</strong> <strong><a href="http://www.advocate.com/year-review/2013/12/16/advocates-person-year-pope-francis" title="Read on original link">The Advocate</a>.</strong></p>

            <p><strong><img src="http://www.advocate.com/sites/advocate.com/files/imce/uploadedimages/daily-news/2013/ADV_POPE_FRANCISx633.jpg" alt="" /></strong></p>

            <p>And as a openly gay and devoted Catholics, I am truly proud of him and The Advocate for their open mindedness.</p>

            <p>Personally, I see many qualities in Pope Francis that I like and adore.</p>

            <p>He rebel, and I am a rebel, so I pretty much get him. Unlike former Popes, he doesn’t follow all that Vatican’s codes and rules, for good reasons.</p>

            <p>He has the characteristics of a leader that we wish all our leaders had. He is not perfect but he walks the walk. He walks the walk.</p>

            <p>And here’s some of them:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Picture 1. He acknowledged that atheists can be good people.</strong></p>

              <p>Earlier in 2013,  Pope Francis spoke out against the common interpretation within the Church that atheists, by nature, are bad people. He stated that, “Atheists should be seen as good people if they do good.” After meeting the Pope, the openly atheist president of Uruguay, Jose Mujica, compared Francis to a friendly neighbor. </p>

              <p><strong>Picture 2. He denouced judgement on homosexuals</strong></p>

              <p>Pope Francis has stated several times that the Church has no right to interfere spiritually in the lives of gays and lesbians. Though Francis maintained the right of the Church to express opinions on homosexuality, he believes that Christians should not judge or ridicule.</p>

              <p><strong>Picture 3. He PERSONALLY called and consoled victim of rape</strong></p>

              <p>A 44-year old Argentinian woman, raped by a local policeman, was one of thousands to write a letter to Pope Francis in 2013. The woman was surprised when she later received a phone call from Francis himself—who consoled the woman and told her, “You are not alone.”</p>

              <p><strong>Picture 4. He auctioned his motorcycle to the benefit to the homeless</strong></p>

              <p>In October, Francis donated his own Harley Davidson motorcycle to fund a hostel and soup kitchen in Rome.</p>

              <p><strong>Picture 5. He urged the protection of Amazon Rainforest</strong></p>

              <p>During his visit to Brazil, Pope Francis met with natives who have been fighting ranchers and farmers attempting to invade their land. He encouraged that the Amazon be treated as a garden and protected.</p>

              <p><strong>Picture 6. he snuck out of the Vatican to feed the homeless.</strong></p>

              <p>More recently, it has been discovered that Pope Francis regularly leaves the Vatican at night to feed the homeless. Dressed as an ordinary priest, he joins Archbishop Konrad Krajewski to feed the poor of Rome.</p>

              <p><strong>Picture 7. He held a major ceremony at the chapel of a youth prison.</strong></p>

              <p>In March, the Pope held a major Holy Week service at Casal del Marmo jail for minors, rather than the Vatican. During the service, the pope washed and kissed the feet of 12 young offenders to commemorate Jesus’ gesture of humility towards his apostles on the night before he died.</p>

              <p><strong>Picture 8. He invited a boy wit Downs Syndrome for a ride in Popemobile.</strong></p>

              <p>During a general audience, Pope Francis invited Alberto di Tullio, a 17-year-old boy with Downs Syndrome, to ride in his Popemobile while thousands watched.</p>

              <p><strong>Picture 9. He embraced and kissed Vinicio Riva</strong></p>

              <p>November saw Pope Francis embrace Vinicio Riva, a man scarred by a genetic disease. Fighting agonising pain on a daily basis, such an act restored the faith of a man who says that he is often mocked in public.</p>

              <p><strong>Picture 10. He spoke out against frivolous spending by the Church.</strong></p>

              <p>The average set of cardinal’s clothes costs as much as $20,000. In October, Pope Francis urged officials to dress more modestly and to not squander such money. In the same month, he ordered a German bishop to explain how he had spent $3 million on a marble courtyard.</p>

          <p>HOW HAS THE AWESOME POPE NOT BEEN REBLOGGED FURTHER?</p>

          <p>Look, I’m not a Christian. I’m a practicing LaVeyan Satanist. But THIS GUY HERE…</p>

          <p>I respect him. I like him. I look forward to seeing him do more good things. And I’ll reblog this a thousand times because, FUCK, Pope Awesome is AWESOME.</p>

          <p>AND CAN WE REALIZE FOR A SECOND THE POPE RODE A HARLEY?!?!!</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>As a Catholic, I have to say it’s really weird having a pope who seems to care about people. A good kind of weird, just…not something I would have ever expected.  I just kind of assumed they elected popes based entirely on their proficiency in covering up child rape and Nazi collaboration scandals.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>This is a pretty awesome pope</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>FINALLY a real pope!</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As a religious studies nut, I love him. My college roommate and I hoped he’d get picked, mostly because we wanted to see what he’d do (she also majored in religious studies). I’m pretty happy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the head of a criminal organisation says something that is just plain common sense and he is up for “Person of the Year”?</p>

<p>That truly makes me sad!</p>
