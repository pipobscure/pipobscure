<blockquote>
  <p>I’m puzzled. Why do people belittle eBooks? If you love books, love to read, I hope it’s the content you love, the written words, the way they’re expressed, the ideas and thoughts that are communicated. Not the physical presentation. I don’t care if the words, the ideas, are on stone, bark, leaves, clay, walls, skins, or yes, paper. It’s what they say, what they contain, and what they pass on and down from person to person and generation to generation and from age to age and culture to culture that matters to me.</p>
