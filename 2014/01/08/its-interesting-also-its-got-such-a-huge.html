        <p>It’s interesting. Also, it’s got such a huge female following. The original [Sir Arthur Conan Doyle] stories had a huge female following, which I’d never forgotten, and that’s because the Victorian ladies liked the way Sherlock looked. (Laughs.) So I thought, use this massively exciting, rather handsome man who could see right through your heart and have no interest … of course, he’s going to be a sex god! I think we pitched that character right. I think our female fanbase all believe that they’ll be the one to melt that glacier. They’re all wrong, nothing will melt that glacier.</p>

<p>I’m sorry, the answer you have provided does not compute. Could you mean:</p>

<p>“young women love a thrilling detective show as much as men do”<br />
<em>or</em><br />
“young women enjoy the (explicitly homoerotic and) incredibly dynamic friendship of a person and his best friend, and how it grows over time”<br />
<em>or</em><br />
“young women appreciate the visual and mental stimulation of good television programming”</p>

<p>You can also try “young women are not limited exclusively to liking things because they find someone physically appealing,” “young women as a whole do not want to be the one to ‘fix’ an emotionally unavailable sociopathic man, and it is damaging to assume that having those qualities makes someone a ‘sex god’,” or “young women do not imagine themselves with Sherlock, moron, do you even know your fanbase, every square inch of it is covered in Johnlock because <em>women appreciate the interplay between those two characters, not everyone is a goddamned Mary Sue like you, god damn it.</em>”</p>

<p>Please try again.</p>

<p>Does he realize the original stories were <em>written down?</em> I think Sherlock looked however his readers wanted him to look!</p>

<p>But you do realize, that the characters they imagined when they read a good detective novel were fucking HOT. Not like average hot, but sizzling. Why do you think that “Victorian Ladies” had an insufficiently naughty imagination? ;)</p>
