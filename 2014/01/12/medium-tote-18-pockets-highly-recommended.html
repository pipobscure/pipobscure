<blockquote>
  <p>The original Clippy photo tote bags have pockets that can be personalised or scrapbooked with your own photographs, fabrics and mementoes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I got one of these for my wife for x-mas. She really loved it, so it has her endorsement. But they did screw up the shipping and shipped my order twice. When I got in touch with them about returning the second one, they told me that I should keep it as a gift from them.</p>

<p>So in short, an awesome product, from an awesome company. So if you have a purse-carrying-person you have a gift giving occasion for, this is a definite recommendation.</p>
