        <p>*Question: *hi. im a 17 yr old girl and on friday i went out with friends and i kissed way too many guys but didn’t go all the way with any of them cuz im a virgin and dont just wanna have a random guy fuck me, i’d actually like a boyfriend of at least 4 months which hasn’t happened yet. the problem is that everyone thinks im a tease now and since ur a guy i’d like your opinion. pretty please.</p>

<p>*Answer: *Everyone thinks you’re a tease? Fuck what everyone else thinks. You kissed a few guys, so what?  And you’re still showing integrity about the whole virgin thing.</p>

<p>My opinion is if you had fun kissing all those guys and being a ‘tease’ continue doing it. BE THE BEST DAMN TEASE THERE IS! Do whatever the fuck makes you happy regardless of what others think. Right on!</p>
