    <title>Which brings me back to the original question: _why should the guy feel bad for throwing paper towels? Or better why would we as a society be inclined to permit gross misconduct by someone and blame their victim._ I don’t blame a victim of rape for fighting back. Though this is obviously not in the same league as rape, the principle is the same. We are asking a person who has their personal space violated to excuse the attacker and blame themselves for reacting; in one case because the attacker is a man and the attackee a woman, in another case because the attacker is disabled and the attackee is not?</title>

    <p>Because paper towels are the most effective weapon against zombies.</p>

  <p>How bad will this guy feel when he realizes he just threw something at a disabled person</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question I have is why anyone would think that the guy <em>should</em> feel bad about throwing paper-towels at the guy. If you come at me and invade my personal space, rather than approach me and alert me to the fact that you wish to interact, you are lucky if I only throw paper towels at you.</p>

<p>It makes no difference if you are disabled or not. You approach others with courtesy and don’t sneak up on them. If you do, you are an asshat. And just because you are disabled doesn’t change that.</p>

<p>This guy is taking a huge risk, because it might not have been paper towels. Other people have the instinct to kick out, resulting in a boot in the face. And you cannot nor should you blame the guy throwing the towels for this.</p>

<p>Which brings me back to the original question: <em>why should the guy feel bad for throwing paper towels? Or better why would we as a society be inclined to permit gross misconduct by someone and blame their victim.</em> I don’t blame a victim of rape for fighting back. Though this is obviously not in the same league as rape, the principle is the same. We are asking a person who has their personal space violated to excuse the attacker and blame themselves for reacting; in one case because the attacker is a man and the attackee a woman, in another case because the attacker is disabled and the attackee is not?</p>
