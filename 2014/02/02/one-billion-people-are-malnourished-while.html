        <p>One billion people are malnourished while one-third of the world’s arable land is devoted to the production of feed crops for livestock.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pigbusiness.co.uk/issues/20-facts/">20 True Costs of Factory Pig Farming</a></p>

<p>(and lets not forget that the amount we grow is sufficient to feed those one billion people <em>and then some</em>) </p>

<p>(via <a href="http://delices-detre-vegetalien.tumblr.com/">delices-detre-vegetalien</a>)</p>

<p>This creates the appearance that if we were to stop farming animals, then those <em>one billon people</em> would have food and not be malnourished. That is pure fantasy; Human beings are not fair; if we stopped animal farming, the western world will come up with other uses for arable land and the crops grown there; anything to prevent feeding the malnourished; they’d come up with inventions like fuelling vehicles with crops before even giving the possibility of feeding the world a single thought.</p>

<p>I for one will stick with eating meat.</p>
