        <!-- <p>*Question: *Could you maybe explain some more about the whole ‘fake it till you make it’ thing? You’re my inspiration btw :3</p>

<p>*Answer: *Fake it until you make it is one of my favourite philosophies. It’s a Placebo effect of sorts. People underestimate the power of their brains, and how much it controls, but it can also constrict you. Mind over matter and all that.</p>

<p>There are multiple studies showing placebos. For example if you give someone a sugar tablet (with no medicine) and show them loads of fake research saying how good the tablet is and how it can cure illnesses, but you have to get them to really believe it. Once they believe the tablet is working they usually get better even though there was no medicine present it was just them subconsciously willing themselves to get better.</p>

<p>I remember when I was younger. We live near the beach so we used to spend practically all summer there. There was this row of big boulders that lined the car park, and I always tried to jump from one rock to the other pretending I was a superhero. But there was this one rock that was spaced a little wider. No matter how much I tried I could never make the jump. It wasn’t that the distance was unattainable (the gap was probably just about a foot wider) it was that I was afraid that if I missed it I would hurt myself. One time I was chasing my cousin down the rocks, I had nearly caught up to her, she was one rock ahead. So I just jumped and caught her. Without even realising I had made the jump that I had been afraid to make for years. And ever since then I was always able to make the jump, because I knew I could. </p>

<p><strong>The moral of that story is that confidence does an awful lot for a person. Sometime just thinking you can do something is enough.</strong></p>

<p>Fear holds people back, they’re afraid of failure, or that they can’t handle a situation or whatever. But what is there really to fear? So what you failed, now you get to try again.</p>

<p><strong>The only real loser is the one who was so afraid of losing that they never even tried. They had already lost before they even had a chance to win.</strong></p>

<p>So that’s where fake it until you make it comes in. You want to be more confident? more successful? more outgoing? Fake it. Act like you already are all those things. It’ll be weird and awkward at first, believe me I know. But fuck it. Just DO IT! Eventually it’ll become second nature, and you won’t be faking it anymore. You’ll know what you’re capable of and in essence that’s the make it part. Hope I helped.</p>
