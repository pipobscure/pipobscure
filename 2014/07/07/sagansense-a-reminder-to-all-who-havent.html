  <p>A reminder to all who haven’t heard: <strong>THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS WILL RIDE AGAIN…<em>FUELED BY NETFLIX</em>…IN 2016.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>You read that right.</strong> Through <a href="http://mashable.com/category/netflix/">Netflix’s</a> acquisition of <a href="http://www.scholastic.com/home/">Scholastic</a>, a <strong>26-episode series will kick off in 2016, called <em>The Magic School Bus 360°</em>.</strong></p>

  <p>From the announcement <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/06/11/magic-school-bus-netflix/">via Mashable</a>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Netflix and Scholastic Media announced in a press statement that <strong>the new series will use CGI animation to feature a “<em>modernized Ms. Frizzle</em>“ and an ”<em>inventive high-tech bus</em>”</strong> — so it looks like the companies are not afraid to take chances and make mistakes (and probably get messy in the process). The very 21st-century show <strong>will also focus on modern tech innovations, including robotics and wearables.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>“<em>The all-new episodes also leverage advancements in animation, science and technology in a way that will delight a new generation of young viewers, and like its predecessor, will help kids around the world discover the magic and value of exploration and innovation,</em>”</strong> a press statement reads.</p>

    <p><em><a href="http://youtu.be/1CYIlaOo3JI">Listen to the original Magic School Bus theme music</a></em></p>

    <p>The Magic School Bus is <strong>the longest-running kids’ science series in history, first airing on PBS in 1994 and continuing in syndication for 18 consecutive years. It has even earned an Emmy Award.</strong> (Undoubtedly for Liz the Lizard’s acting.)</p>

    <p><strong>“<em>Magic School Bus, the old version, is remarkably popular on Netflix,</em>”</strong> Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/11/business/media/netflix-orders-new-childrens-show-based-on-magic-school-bus.html?_r=1">told The New York Times.</a> <strong>“<em>It teaches science in a way that transcends generations.</em>”</strong></p>

    <p>Scholastic Media has not yet announced if the original Ms. Frizzle, Lily Tomlin, will return to voice the character.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And from a similar announcement <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/11/news/companies/netflix-magic-school-bus/">via CNN</a>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>“<em>To do an animated show that has actually encouraged young people to pursue careers in the sciences or teaching makes us very, very happy.</em>”</strong></p>

    <p><strong>— Forte,</strong> President, <a href="http://www.scholastic.com/aboutscholastic/scholasticmedia.htm"><em>Scholastic Media</em></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong>2016. The Magic School Bus. The original ship of the imagination.</strong></p>
