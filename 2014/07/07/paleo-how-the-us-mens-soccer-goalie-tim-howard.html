<blockquote>
  <p>“I’ve been paleo for about a year…</p>

  <p>“My personal trainer suggested paleo to build muscle while staying lean, and it’s one of the first plans that’s worked for me.</p>

  <p>Sure, I like ice cream, but when you keep a healthy lifestyle, it’s: Do you prefer sweets and crappy food, or do you prefer to have a nice body? It depends on what you want more. Breakfast is meat or eggs, and nuts. Lunch and dinner are more meat and a steamed green vegetable. Depending on how intense training was, I throw in extra carbs, like sweet potatoes.</p>

  <p>“Three mornings a week, I exercise before eating — it’s called fasted cardio — to burn fat.</p>

  <p>“Ideally, I’m in bed by 10 p.m. That’s all I have left. I like to get more than my normal 10 hours of sleep nights before a game. Athletes do so much to take care of their bodies, yet sleep is the element most get wrong. I even nap for an hour after practice. It’s my favorite part of the day.”“</p>
