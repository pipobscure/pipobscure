    <title>Just did the quiz as well. The embarrassing thing with this is that roughly 50% of participants got a failing grade (less than 65% correct). Now these are all things that you either learn in high-school or that make regular appearances on the news. So there weren’t really any questions on there that require any serious training, skill or expertise more than not sleepwalking through life. Yet a majority of people couldn’t get a passing grade.</title>
