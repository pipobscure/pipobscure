<blockquote>
  <p>There is no such things as ‘innocent’ or ‘guilty’ Palestinians. Armed resistance to fascist occupation <em>is their right</em>.</p>

  <p>What israel and our media shamelessly calls ‘militants’ are Palestinian <em>people</em> fighting to defend their land and their families.</p>

  <p>They deserve just as much respect and dignity.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no such thing as “Palestinians” since there is no such country as “Palestine”. An person from Gaza or the West-Bank attacking Israel is nothing more than a vile terrorist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You see, there are at least two sides to the story. And being that there are currently missiles being shot at Israel, tunnels with weapons being found, and missiles demonstrably being hidden in schools, there is very little sympathy for Palestinians.</p>

<p>So until Palestinians realise that Hamas, in their goal of violent destruction of Israel, does not serve them they are the biggest obstacle to their own safety.</p>
