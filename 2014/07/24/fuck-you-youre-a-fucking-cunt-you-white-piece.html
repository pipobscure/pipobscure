        <p>*Question: *Fuck you! You’re a fucking cunt, you white piece of shit</p>

<p>*Answer: *Ouhhh, Aaaahhh, what a brilliant piece of prose.</p>

<p>First off: no thanks, I’d rather not fuck you. I prefer living in a faithful monogamous relationship.</p>

<p>Second: your observational and deductive reasoning skills seem to be severely lacking. Let me demonstrate by plucking your last sentence apart into its component statements:</p>

<p>1. You are a fucking cunt<br />
2. You are white<br />
3. You are a piece of shit</p>

<p>As to the first one, considering my severe lack if such an organ, it is simply biologically impossible for me to be a cunt, much less a fucking cunt. If I were to infer from the terseness if your prose that it originated on a mobile device I could then assume you meant to say: “You are fucking a cunt” a statement that while occasionally true, lacks any contextual relevance.</p>

<p>As to the second, you have brilliantly deduced from my posts and profile photo. Bravo. Though I fail to see the contextual relevance once more.</p>

<p>As to the third, you are simply mistaking qualities. Shit is the processed and excreted food-waste of animals. I on the other hand am an animal. Now one could claim that the world is shit and since I live in it we share an identity, but that would be a bit much philosophy and metaphysics to infer from you prose.</p>

<p>So in closing, you get a 1 out of 3 on your observational skills, which is not a passing grade. Now I could of course be utterly wrong and mistake your attempts at insults for actual coherent expression. That however would sadden me because it means that I have failed to demonstrate that the oral flatulence of an anonymous ask has very little impact on my self esteem.</p>
