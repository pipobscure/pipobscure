    <h1>The first day of school</h1>
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I am happy to report that both kids really liked their first day of school. Both have found a few friends already and are happy to go back. So it seems as if school is working out alright.</p>

<p>In other news: I have a sever toothache since Monday. Bad enough that I went to the dentist today. Any case, I have a major infection on one tooth that I had a root canal on about a year ago. It will need recrowning so we are talking a multi visit thing. For now I’m on a course of antibiotics for the infection and pain relievers for the pain. On the 18th I’ll get rid of the old crown and then we’ll see. Yikes, it’s going to be a painful month.</p>
