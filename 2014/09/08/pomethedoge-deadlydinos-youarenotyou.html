    <title>Why is there the assumption that I tried to get out of the “friendzone”? Maybe that compliment was just stating a truth that I felt might brighten the shitty day I saw all over her face and “aw thanks” was already more of an overt reaction than I expected for a simple “I liked that presentation. The hard work you put in was worth it.”</title>

    <p>What’s the appropriate, non-friendzoning response?</p>

    <p>“You look pretty today.”</p>

    <p>“Okay, fine, I’ll suck your dick.”</p>
