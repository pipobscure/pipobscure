    <h1>Pro Tip: Do Not Trust Google Maps</h1>
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>About a year and a half ago I used GoogleMaps and got led to turn left the wrong way on a major thoroughfare. Well I didn’t blame Google, after all what did I expect.</p>

<p>What I did instead is report the problem. I marked it, described the precise issue and jumped through all their hoops. In the end I was notified that my input was now part of Google Maps. YIPPEEH!!!</p>

<p>Today I asked Google Maps again for directions. And guess what, it made the same goddamn mistake again. Not similar, THE FUCKING SAME MISTAKE that leads you down the wrong side of a highway. The same fucking mistake, that I fucking helped them fix more than a year ago.</p>

<p>Now in my book, when you make a potentially dangerous error, that’s a mistake; if you are told and don’t fix it, it’s negligence; if you are told, and claim to have fixed it and don’t, then that’s gross negligence.</p>

<p>And guess what. Gross negligence makes you liable even if you disclaim liability. Watch out Google, this is the way companies get sued into oblivion and I’d hate that.</p>
