<p>I really don’t want to hear this crap about “race-discrimination”, “rape-culture” and the like any more. I’m a white middle aged male and I’m sick of it!</p>

<p>Now before you go all apeshit at me, let me explain what I mean.</p>

<p>More than a century ago slaves were freed and it became law that truly all men should be equal.</p>

<p>Almost 100 years ago, women got the vote and it was established into law that there is gender equality.</p>

<p>About 50 years ago it was reiterated that race should not be a criterion.</p>

<p>And in 2014 youths are being shot simply for being black-skinned, women are molested simply for walking down the street, people run scared because their gender identity doesn’t match what some scatterbrained ass thinks it should.</p>

<p>I don’t want a world where race is an issue. I don’t want a world where gender is an issue. I don’t want a world where people have to be rightfully scared simply because of who they are.</p>

<p>I want a world where race is what it is, an evolutionary characteristic of ones DNA. I want a world where gender is part accident at birth. Where gender identity is truly irrelevant because no one cares what you identify as and just people accept your word for it.</p>

<p>Now I realise that this is not the world we live in, but I want it to be the world we strive for. A world where I don’t hear about race-discrimination or rape-culture because there is no such thing.</p>

<p>Now until we have such a world keep screaming and protesting and ranting. I might not want to hear it, but we have to hear it if we ever want to get over that crap.</p>
