<p>I am, and have been for a long time, an arbitrator in a similar forum, albeit with much less impact and disputes with little monetary implication. As such it should not be surprising that I feel no qualms with the concept of declaring such a forum the venue for disputes.</p>

<p>Having supranational arbitration as the ultimate recourse does have value especially if one of the parties may be a nation. We might be willing to trust that a UK court would act with impartiality, but do we place that same trust in a U.S. court; a Russian court; a Somali court; or another of your choice?</p>

<p>However this particular establishment is a blemish on the concept and reputation of arbitration in general. The most important thing about any institution of justice, whether national or not, is transparency. Only through transparency can there ever be any trust in the impartiality of such a forum.</p>

<p>Of course confidentiality may be required to protect the innocent from time to time. I have myself been involved in such cases. However this needs to be a well documented and explained exception and by no means the rule.</p>

<p>The LCIA does an incredible injustice to arbitration, judicial institutions and the world in general. I would therefore advise anyone agreeing to any arbitration (and we all do more often than one would think) to refrain from ever accepting the jurisdiction of a forum that insists on confidentiality as a general rule.</p>

      <p>not voting isn’t refusing to play the game. You’re in this country, you’re subject to the game whether you like it or not. The only way not to play is to leave, and the vast majority of us don’t have that option.</p>

      <p>**Not voting is playing the game but saying ‘pass’ every time your turn comes up and then wondering why you lost.<br />

    </blockquote>

    <p>Making young people not vote is actually a tactic used in politics to keep the satus quo. The young vote is always the one for change, so dissuading them from voting at all is actually a political tactic used by the people in charge to keep themselves there.</p>

    <p>Voting is rebellion.</p>

  <p>Choosing to not vote (not being able to for pretty much any reason is a different story) does nothing but give your permission to establish a dictatorship.</p>

  <p>Substitute black for white and tell me what you think.</p>

<p>You are so totally right…</p>

<p>except: “Every year during MLK week I try not to spend a dime at a black owned business. No Problem!” would have to be the statement. Well I guess that shows the problem.</p>

<p>except: It’s pretending there weren’t just a couple of hundred years of slavery and discrimination culminating in an epidemic of killings by police that should make anyone sick to their heart.</p>

<p>except: Racism requires not just classification based on skin-colour, but discrimination. Which in turn requires the capability and use of disproportionate power toward oppressive ends. So right now, there is no such thing as “black racism”.</p>

<p>except: Oh fuck it, “black racism”, “meninism”, and the like don’t really add anything to the conversation. It’s a nice sounding excuse, but really, so long as we as a society have not attained anywhere near equal rights and opportunities for everyone, your “reverse reacism” comments are an insult to every thinking human who wants a better world.</p>
