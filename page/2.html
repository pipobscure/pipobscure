<p>Tories are the party of business. British business are shorting now. When Britain suffers they massively buy public assets on the cheap with the gains from shorting. When people suffer, we’ll all gladly rejoin the EU and we’re back where we were. Except that the Tories have succeeded in privatising everything (think NHS, police, roads, DWP admin, …)</p>

<p>Sounds crazy? Well it’s the only rational explanation for still wanting Brexit. If that’s crazy, then that is the appropriate adjective.</p>

    <p>Margaret Chase Smith said “Public service must be more than doing a job efficiently and honestly. It must be a complete dedication to the people and to the nation.”</p>

<p>Right now I’d be satisfied with either efficiently or honestly, which shows you how easy it is to lower ones standards.</p>

    <p>Some politicians and CEOs boast that they need only four hours’ sleep, but it simply isn’t true. Take Donald Trump, for example. If this were the case, the scientific evidence would suggest he would be overweight, show erratic behaviour, poor judgment and frequent mood swings.</p>

<p>Well that explains Trump. He’s just not getting enough sleep. Poor baby.</p>

<p>Hi XXXXXX,</p>

<p>thanks for getting in touch, but from what you have written, I don’t think these roles are for me.</p>

<p>I would like to give you a piece of information though, which may help you to target your approaches better:</p>

<p>Java and JavaScript have as much in common as Horse &amp; Horseradish. So if you are looking for a Jokey, approaching someone whose resume screams “tangy roots” will line you up for an eye-watering disappointment.</p>

<p>To remain inside the metaphor: if you ever happen to be in search of someone to make a great accompaniment to salmon, please feel free to get in touch.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>
