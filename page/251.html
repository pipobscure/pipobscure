      <blockquote>
        <p>i really hate seeing children at gay rallies. in most cases, they don’t understand what they’re doing and what they’re promoting. i think most children are pressured into going to gay rallies by their parents and, therefore, pressured into believing in gay marriage. </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p><em>Excuse you</em>, I knew about homosexuality since I was <em>four</em>. With five years I could already argue about it and with six I had a formed opinion. All my mother<strong>S</strong> did was explain to me what it was, without ever telling me if it was good of bad.</p>

      <p>The truth is that is actually easier for kids to understand homosexuality, and maybe even accept it, if they are told about it at a young age.  </p>

      <p>Yes, maybe the two-years-old kids there are not sure of whats going on, but their parents are raising them to open their minds and accept differences without it being a huge deal.</p>

      <p>It’s funny how people don’t mind dragging kids at sundays to the church, to make them sit and listen to things they can’t understand nor question, but it’s so wrong to take them to a walk were they can see pretty rainbows , and later understand what they mean.</p>

      <p>This is bullshit.</p>

  <p><strong>Day 140:</strong> how do you feel about people disrespecting their parents?<br />
I feel like a lot of people don’t appreciate their parents enough, but there are definitely some parents who treat their kids like shit and don’t deserve any respect. I feel really bad for people who still respect (or try to respect) their abusive parents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should become a politician. This was a perfect politician answer:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Repeat the statement of the question (there are people disrespecting their parents)</li>
  <li>Switch topics by making a loosley related statement (some parents abuse their kids)</li>
  <li>Give a quanswer (question framed as an answer) about your own statement (I don’t get kids respecting their abusive parents)</li>
</ol>

<p>And presto, question has been evaded without an answer. However, since you are not in a political forum, here you can be called on it. So start again:</p>

<p><em>How do you feel about people disrespecting their parents?</em></p>

    <p>Try to imagine a life without timekeeping. You probably can’t. You know the month, the year, the day of the week. There is a clock on your wall or the dashboard of your car. You have a schedule, a calendar, a time for dinner or a movie. Yet all around you, timekeeping is ignored. Birds are not late. A dog does not check its watch. Deer do not fret over passing birthdays. Man alone measures time. Man alone chimes the hour. And, because of this, man alone suffers a paralyzing fear that no other creature endures. A fear of time running out.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>My 5-year-old insists that Bilbo Baggins is a girl.</p>

<p>The first time she made this claim, I protested. Part of the fun of reading to your kids, after all, is in sharing the stories you loved as a child. And in the story I knew, Bilbo was a boy. A boy hobbit. (Whatever that entails.)</p>

<p>But my daughter was determined. She liked the story pretty well so far, but Bilbo was definitely a girl. So would I please start reading the book the right way? I hesitated. I imagined Tolkien spinning in his grave. I imagined mean letters from his testy estate. I imagined the story getting as lost in gender distinctions as dwarves in the Mirkwood.</p>

<p>Then I thought: What the hell, it’s just a pronoun. My daughter wants Bilbo to be a girl, so a girl she will be. And you know what? The switch was easy. Bilbo, it turns out, makes a terrific heroine. She’s tough, resourceful, humble, funny, and uses her wits to make off with a spectacular piece of jewelry. Perhaps most importantly, she never makes an issue of her gender—and neither does anyone else.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Brian Brenberg,<br />
I have seldomly read such utter nonsense. The King’s College of NYC should be ashamed to count you among their professors.</p>

<p>While it is true that “the money has to come from somewhere”, employment is not simply a question of supply and demand. So when the labour costs more than your product is worth, you are selling your product too cheaply. If you cannot turn a profit on your product without exploiting your labour force, you should not be making your product.</p>
