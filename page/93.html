<p>By the late 20th century the United States had begun it‚Äôs decline.</p>

<p>By the late 29th century fundamentalist Christianity was rampant in the United States.</p>

<p>Now I realise that correlation does not speak to causation, but twice is more than just pure coincidence. First Rome now the U.S. begs the question of who will be the next victim. üòÄ</p>

<p>I have held a US license since 1994 and an Austrian license since 1996. Nevertheless the UK government in its infinite wisdom held it necessary that I actually get a British license, theory practical and all. But only after a year, because that long my license is considered valid in the UK.</p>

<p>Ok, I thought, I can do that and went on to do them. No problem. What did get me though is that my car insurance company was aware of all of this. So when I informed them, as I was obliged to, that I had indeed confirmed fully with the law, they decided this would be a good opportunity to increase my car insurance by a factor of 3.5. After all, I had just gotten my license and could not drive worth shit having only 1 day of experience.</p>

<p>Several freak-outs and polite invectives later that is now my former insurer. I then found myself a new company. It‚Äôs a bit more expensive than my previous one (+50% or a factor of 1.5) but still cheaper than the ¬£&amp;@‚Ç¨$# previous one.</p>

<p>Which leaves me with just one question: Who defecated into their cerebrae? What kind of numb-scull would think that‚Äôs a solid way to do business?</p>

<p>Just watched ‚ÄúImitation Game‚Äù. Beside the fact that Benedict Cumberbatch did a marvellous job, I am left feeling incredibly sad that we bereft ourselves of a brilliant mind like Turing‚Äôs. The writing at the end hit a nerve ‚Äú2013 Queen Elisabeth posthumously pardoned him‚Äù? What exactly was there to pardon? She should have posthumously apologised to him and asked his pardon instead.</p>
