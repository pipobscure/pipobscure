<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Joshua Kopstein</strong> writes about the Jeremy Hammond case, and how hacktivism and leaking have created a <a href="http://nyr.kr/1i0mexn">new type of political dissenter</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two striking things in the article that are food for thought:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Calculation of damages plays a major role in establishing penalties. Yet the methods used are largely arbitrary. This goes for hacktivism as well as copyright infringement. As this is at the root of U.S. justice, it might be worth to campaign for higher standards there. One possibility could be to require proven damage and cause, so whoever claims that a damage occurred has the burden of proof in terms of both the amount of damage as well as the cause.</li>
  <li>The U.S. justice system seems to be totally out of step with the rest of the world. It is slowly but surely getting more and more stringent. It is in fact going from a measured and fair system of justice to something quite different. The U.S. are now no longer in line with what the western world conceives of as fairness and justice, but rather with what the Chinese and arab worlds think of as justice. Now this might be because the rest of the western states have gotten weak and ineffectual, but it might well also be that there is a serious moral regression in progress in the U.S.</li>

<p>I just finished another book by Maxx Barry. This is definitely a worthwhile author. After “Jennifer Government” this book goes of in an entirely different direction: What if words and language were capable of controlling human behaviour and some humans learned this skill. Another great read!</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2509044/Google-chief-Eric-Schmidt-explains-block-child-porn.html">Google chief Eric Schmidt explains block on child porn</a></p>

<p>What people fail to realise when they scream “let’s get rid of child porn” is that they become part of the problem. It’s sort of like saying “let’s get rid of the bodies so no one will notice that there’s a genocide”. It works if your aim is to prevent people from noticing that there’s a problem, but it doesn’t aid the victims nor prevent new victims. In fact by hiding the symptoms you prevent the proper level of outrage and counter action.</p>

<p>Imagine every image of every child that has been or is being abused is instantly findable on the web and presented front and centre to anyone searching for terms that relate to children.</p>

<p>How many images of child abuse do you think you would see before you would hit the streets and force our police to hunt these people down and nail their balls to a wall in a court of law? How much funding would such an effort garner then? How effective could the police be if there were serious pressure on them to actually do something?</p>

<p>Instead we ask companies like Google to hide those pictures from us knowing full well that this will not stop child pornography. We take any pressure off our police and our courts to actually do something. We allow politicians to skate by with claiming to do something about child pornography when in reality they are just hiding it from us.</p>

<p>Instead we we allow governments to regulate speech. Yes it’s speech that we find abhorrent, but it is speech. We forfeit our liberties for the sake of the children while at the same time doing them a disservice. After all, it’s the acts that lead to those images and not the images that are abhorrent and that is where the crime should be sought out and punished.</p>
