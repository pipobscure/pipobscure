  <p>At first I thought I was being a pioneer in childhood development but apparently loads of other kids with SPD and fine motor coordination issues do better at cursive than print.</p>

  <p>Just another example of why I’m so glad to homeschool, cursive will not be taught in the public schools AT ALL until maybe 7th grade. My son’s printing is barely legible and trying to correct him is torture for us both. Starting over with new instructions seems to be a happy place.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s like presenting a dog with a sirloin steak and expecting him not to eat it.”</p>

  <p>Well.</p>

  <p>I presented my two dogs with an actual sirloin steak, then told them no.</p>

  <p>Woofles didn’t even approach it when I set it down, as I hadn’t told him it was okay to do so.<br />
Quinn approached it, completely ready to take it from the plate (as her manners are not yet as good as Woofles’ manners), was told no, and immediately backed off.</p>

  <p>When Woofles heard the no, he turned away as well because he knew that steak was not for him to eat.</p>

  <p><strong>Notice how they didn’t ‘argue’, didn’t take it anyway, didn’t get aggressive, didn’t beg, or didn’t try to somehow persuade me that they should be able to have it.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>They were told no, they backed off.</strong></p>

  <p>So, essentially, if you use that analogy to excuse rape, you’re saying you have <em>less</em> self control and <em>fewer</em> basic social manners than my two dogs.</p>

  <p>That also probably means you should be neutered and kept on a leash.</p>

<p>I recommend this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Science-Low-Carbohydrate-Living-ebook/dp/B005CVV2AE/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389048888&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=low+carbohydrate+living">The Art and Science of Low-Carbohydrate Living</a>.
