  <div class="content">
    <p>Social networks are designed around who you are and who you know. They’re for 24/7 contact with your family, classmates, friends, bosses, coworkers, ex-classmates, ex-bosses, ex-coworkers, ex-friends, ex-family, and exes, in a medium that doesn’t leave much room for humanity, filtering, subtlety, and nuance. Some people love it; I only see the irrelevance, drama, and baggage that comes with it, and being politically impossible to un-“friend” many of them. As a teenager, I escaped from these real-life people, problems, and social statuses to the internet — the last thing I wanted was to be surrounded by them there, too.</p>

<p>Yeah well sometimes even a brilliant man is wrong (as he is on vaccines) but as you say, he’s so on point with this.</p>

  <p>I really like seeing your personal posts, even the whiny angsty ones, and particularly the strange boring ones. I like these little windows into your lives even if I’ve never seen pictures of you and all I really know is that we like a few of the same tv shows. Please continue to let me read your to do lists and your conversations with strange relatives.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>It is evident that rape-culture is a thing and we have come to accept that #NotAllMen is just a feeble excuse for silently accepting and promoting it.</p>

<p>And then there is an act of religiously motivated terror like that in Paris. The first commentary that I heard after the report was “Not All Muslims” are violent retrogrades. You know what: IT’S THE SAME LAME EXCUSE</p>

<p>And I’m having none of it. I know that not all men are rapists, not all Muslims are terrorists and not all religions call for the unconditional annihilation of unbelievers. But I don’t care. My tolerance is at its end.</p>

<p>I refuse to make concessions for people peddling non-sense. If you want to pray in your own home and believe in bollocks of any kind, be my guest. That’s your thing. But when you enter the public sphere your superstitions have no place.</p>

<p>And just in case you were wondering: I’m not islamophobic I’m islamomisic. (and christomisic, and religiomisic for that matter)</p>
