    <p>Almost half of adults in the U.S. believe in at least one medical conspiracy theory, according to a report by the University of Chicago. Some conspiracy theories are widely held: Some 37% believe that the Food and Drug Administration is purposely concealing information on natural, alternative treatments for cancer, while only a third of respondents said they disagreed with that theory. The most well-known theory was the myth that vaccinations can trigger autistic spectrum disorders, although this theory has been thoroughly debunked by medical researchers. Nearly 70% of the respondents said that they had heard of the theory, while 20% believe it to be true.</p>

<p>If you are thinking about economics or innovation or technology or the world in general, then this is a must read book. It’s written from a pro-Israeli point of view, but the thoughts and analysis is interesting whatever your views.</p>

    <p>*Question: *Fuck you! You’re a fucking cunt, you white piece of shit</p>

<p>*Answer: *Ouhhh, Aaaahhh, what a brilliant piece of prose.</p>

<p>First off: no thanks, I’d rather not fuck you. I prefer living in a faithful monogamous relationship.</p>

<p>Second: your observational and deductive reasoning skills seem to be severely lacking. Let me demonstrate by plucking your last sentence apart into its component statements:</p>

<p>1. You are a fucking cunt<br />
2. You are white<br />
3. You are a piece of shit</p>

<p>As to the first one, considering my severe lack if such an organ, it is simply biologically impossible for me to be a cunt, much less a fucking cunt. If I were to infer from the terseness if your prose that it originated on a mobile device I could then assume you meant to say: “You are fucking a cunt” a statement that while occasionally true, lacks any contextual relevance.</p>

<p>As to the second, you have brilliantly deduced from my posts and profile photo. Bravo. Though I fail to see the contextual relevance once more.</p>

<p>As to the third, you are simply mistaking qualities. Shit is the processed and excreted food-waste of animals. I on the other hand am an animal. Now one could claim that the world is shit and since I live in it we share an identity, but that would be a bit much philosophy and metaphysics to infer from you prose.</p>

<p>So in closing, you get a 1 out of 3 on your observational skills, which is not a passing grade. Now I could of course be utterly wrong and mistake your attempts at insults for actual coherent expression. That however would sadden me because it means that I have failed to demonstrate that the oral flatulence of an anonymous ask has very little impact on my self esteem.</p>

    <p>I just dropped half our household at household (due to the move) at the local women’s shelter.</p>

<p>* 1 box of DVDs<br />
* 1 box of Books<br />
* 1 box of Womens Clothing<br />
* 1 box of Childrens clothing<br />
* 2 boxes of Toys<br />
* 1 box of Food (Rice, Pasta, Beans, …)</p>

<p>It made me feel acutely uncomfortable, because I felt the intense feeling of dislike rolling of these women mixed with fear and chuzpa and…</p>

<p>I watched these three slight women wrestle with these heavy and huge boxes that I had trouble with when loading. They seemed like the ant carrying the apple in the cartoons, except without any of the grace of the ant.</p>

<p>Suppressing my instinct to just pick up a box and carry it in I found it a challenge to accept that I was not welcome in their lair. Yet the fact that such places are needed is made abundantly clear by the radiating suspicion of these women.</p>

<p>This is likely the only situation I have actually experienced where I could glimpse what any minority experiences full force: the combination of overt welcome and covert distrust and dislike.</p>

<p>So while I would discourage white males to go around the local women’s shelter for the experience, if you ever get the chance then pay attention to all the subliminal things going on. It can be a learning experience.</p>

    <p><em>Warning: Legal Geeking Ahead!</em></p>

<p>It’s really worth while reading the decisions in these two cases from July 22nd 2014. Both are regarding the same issue and on the same level.</p>

<p>One <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/10125254D91F8BAC85257D1D004E6176/%24file/14-5018-1503850.pdf">claims that the federally operated exchange is not “an exchange stablished by the state”</a> and the <a href="http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/nlj/king_usca4_20140722.pdf">second claims the exact opposite</a>.</p>

<p>Why should you read them? Because as soon as you get to the merits section it becomes painfully obvious, that the author for the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia couldn’t find its ass with two hands. Rarely is such drivel being committed to paper. On the other hand the Court for the Fourth Circuit has judges that are capable of concise, explicative expression. This is actually a fun read, especially when you get to the concurring opinion by Senior Circuit Judge Davis who proceeds to, metaphorically, rip the appellants a new one.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.judges.org/images/mugs/davis.jpg" alt="Judge Davis" /> Judge Davis has just become my hero.</p>
