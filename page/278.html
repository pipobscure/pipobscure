    <p>The (500) Days of Summer attitude of ‚ÄúHe wants you so bad‚Äù seems attractive to some women and men, especially younger ones, but I would encourage anyone who has a crush on my character to watch it again and examine how selfish he is. He develops a mildly delusional obsession over a girl onto whom he projects all these fantasies. He thinks she‚Äôll give his life meaning because he doesn‚Äôt care about much else going on in his life. A lot of boys and girls think their lives will have meaning if they find a partner who wants nothing else in life but them. That‚Äôs not healthy. That‚Äôs falling in love with the idea of a person, not the actual person.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>so lately i‚Äôve been deep in thought about the concept of dating to marry and the current state of my relationship. i‚Äôd never really given marriage and kids much thought before because it seemed like even the possibility of such things was very far away.</p>

  <p>but then i turned 24, and i see all these‚Ä¶</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, then here it goes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Life Stages are Stereo-Types and therefore inherently off To let someone else decide/suggest what you should be doing or feeling at this ‚Äústage‚Äù of your life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What you (or anyone) wants changes about every once every often You think now you want to get married some day. Wait a week or two and you will hate the thought. On the other hand your bf claims to never want kids or get married. Believe you me, between now and when you turn old and grey, that will change at least a dozen times.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing lasts forever, even cold November rain‚Ä¶ File under lyrical reminiscence (you will hear this song frequently played at the old folks home üòä). Is there anyone that really thinks that dropping a good thing because it might end some day? Are you serious? Nothing lasts forever enjoy it while it lasts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dating with a purpose Are you serious? This is 2014 not 1014. It‚Äôs OK to be goal oriented, but it‚Äôs silly to subjugate your heart to your goals. It‚Äôs your goals that should follow your heart, not the other way around!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Staying coupled because you fear being single‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶is something you can do if you are 94 and not 24. And even then that‚Äôs probably among the worst reasons for staying with somebody.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What‚Äôs the point ‚Äúthey date to marry and if it‚Äôs not a possibility, what‚Äôs the point‚Äù whoever this friend is, don‚Äôt you ever listen to her. <strong>The point is to LIVE!</strong> To live, learn, experience, feel, fail, succeed, try, laugh, cry and all the other stuff that makes us more than a waste of oxygen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You never know what the future brings! ‚Äúwhen you can no longer stand the fact that you don‚Äôt have a future with him‚Äù sounds deep, but it really is utter bollocks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You do <strong>NOT</strong> have a track record You are 24 years old, you are barely out of your diapers. When you had three dozen serious (i.e. longer than 6 months) relationships, then maybe you have the beginning of a start of a track record. Until then please refer to #7 and enjoy the uncertainty.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>Now if on the other hand you are simply doubting your relationship, because you find you fell out of love, then that‚Äôs different. Leave now!</p>

<p>The main point is basically that you should basically just enjoy things as they go and not think about getting married at all. Marriage happens or it doesn‚Äôt. You might find the right person, or you might not. You might have children or not. You might even marry and then find out it was a mistake. You might then get divorced and find out that that was a mistake. You might‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Heck <strong>ANYTHING</strong> might happen and you will not know what it will be until it has happened. And that is actually a good thing. So take life as it comes and enjoy it. That‚Äôs actually the point of living to begin with.</p>
