<p>I so understand where you are coming from. I did the same thing around thanksgiving. Except the weeks afterwards my digestion was off and I totally felt like crap. So I swore to myself to give myself treats that actually make me feel good, not ‚Äútreats‚Äù that I regret for weeks.</p>

<p>I hope for you you are more ‚Äúexception tolerant‚Äù than I am and that you will actually not regret that burger and pizza.</p>

<p>As long as one feels good about onesself, everything is legit.</p>

    <p>Every American should know basic math. Every American should understand the logical underpinnings to coding, the way conditional clauses work and the cyclical way in which systems are constructed. Americans should know that the way a website works isn‚Äôt the way a video game works which isn‚Äôt the way a bank‚Äôs database works, but they don‚Äôt need to learn to ‚Äúcode‚Äù all of those things. Just as every American doesn‚Äôt need to get certified as a mechanic, but should know how to change a tire, every American should know how computer systems work in the abstract but doesn‚Äôt need to code.</p>

    <p>While functionally developed in the Netherlands, the most iconic boomboxes were created in Japan during the 1970s and ‚Äô80s. This was a time when Japanese design and manufacturing was evolving from a copying culture to an innovating culture, and the boombox is a great example of this. I want to find the inventors of these important ‚Äúgrail‚Äù boxes and tell the stories of how they designed the machines we love, before it‚Äôs too late.</p>

<p><strong>‚Äúmachines we love‚Äù?</strong> maybe I‚Äôm becoming an old curmudgeon, but until people develop a taste for music (i.e. adopt mine üòâ ) I‚Äôd rather they listen to their music with headphones. So Boom-Boxes are definitely <strong>not machines I love!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Death Announcement</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Sigmund Suitzer, royal empirial judicial councilor, and Mrs. Therese Blum announce in their own name as well as those of all nieces and neffews in deepest sorrow the news of the death of his beloved sister (and aunt)</p>

<p><strong>Babette Beer</strong><br />
<em>widow of a royal empirial professor and gubernatorial councilor</em></p>

<p>who on Friday the 27th of February 1885 at 3¬†o‚Äôclock in the afternoon after lengthy suffering in her 75th year slipped from life into eternal peace. The funeral will take place on Sunday the 1st of March in the morning at half past 9 at the mourning house at Pillersdorfgasse 6 (11th district), just past the central cemetery (Israelite section).</p>

<p><em>this is instead of distinct personal notification</em></p>

<hr />

<p>‚Äî-</p>

<p>And yes the whole thing is basically one single sentence with innumerable sub-clauses. But it‚Äôs gorgeous.</p>

<p>P.S.: royal and empirial whatever is an honorary title achieved by doing any job long enough, and not an actual role.</p>

<p>P.P.S.: these people obviously lived in Vienna, Austria at a time before WWI when antisemitism was less pronounced than at any later time.</p>

<p>You don‚Äôt need to smash the patriarchy, because if your pater is any good at archy he will empower you to do anything you want to achieve and protect you against those trying to tell you what to do.</p>

<p>What you want to smash is the ASSarchy, and any one will look good doing that. So go, go, go for 2014</p>
