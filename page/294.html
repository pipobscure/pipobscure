    <p>If God wants something from me, he would tell me. He wouldn’t leave someone else to do this, as if an infinite being were short on time. And he would certainly not leave fallible, sinful humans to deliver an endless plethora of confused and contradictory messages. God would deliver the message himself, directly, to each and every one of us, and with such clarity as the most brilliant being in the universe could accomplish. We would all hear him out and shout “Eureka!” So obvious and well-demonstrated would his message be. It would be spoken to each of us in exactly those terms we would understand. And we would all agree on what that message was.</p>

  <p class="author">
    <span class="date">2013-11-30 13:06:00 +0000</span>
  </p>
  <div class="content">
    <p>*Question: *Hi, How did you start the Diet? Did you fast? How long did it took you to see results?</p>

<p>*Answer: *Well I started motivated ;)</p>

<p>The first thing I did was read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Science-Carbohydrate-Living/dp/0983490708">The Art Science Carbohydrate Living</a> which gave me a start at the scientific underpinnings which is important because you want to understand what you are doing and what to watch out for.</p>

<p>The second thing I did was schedule an appointment with my doctor to discuss the project with her. This ended up with me getting a full blood work-up as well as a full EKG to establish a baseline.</p>

<p>As for what to eat, I basically followed an Atkins Diet. Just google and you will find all the details you could want.</p>

<p>I also knew that the bathroom scale is a horrible liar. To begin with you body-weight fluctuates ±1kg to begin with. And most bathroom scales have their own inaccuracy. So getting on a scale is something that I decided to avoid. **Pro-Tip: Avoid the measure everything craze. It will not tell you what you want to know**.</p>

<p>What I did do is go in for a check-up every 2 months, again doing a full blood work-up and EKG as well as actually weighing. So yes, I did actually observe closely what was going on, but by not measuring everything thrice a day, I avoided demotivating myself.</p>

<p>So to answer the second part of your question, I don’t know how long it took for something to happen. I just started noticing that my pants began to fall down, that my belt ran out of loops and so on. But it took time. For the major part of my weight-loss it to be over it took pretty close to 6 months. In that time I weighed in 3 times.</p>

<p>I hope this helps. Of course people are different. Some people are motivated by numbers and can ignore them well when they go the wrong way, or don’t go down quick enough for their master plan. I for my part am easily demotivated by slacking or negative trends, so avoiding continuous measurement but closely monitoring, helped me out.</p>

<p>Oh and one important thing: *This is not something you should do to loose weight and when you reached your goal you go back to eating carbs as before. **This is a lifestyle change!** *</p>

<a href="http://thisistheverge.tumblr.com/post/68467978369/the-verge-at-work-using-the-pebble-smartwatch-to">The Verge</a> comes to the same conclusion I did.</p>

<p>The Pebble-Watch has a singular nifty feature and that is notifications. 99% of all texts are so unimportant it’s not even worth taking the phone out of your pocket. But 1% is so crucial, that you simply cannot miss them. So unless you have a Pebble, you are forced to check every text you get by grabbing your phone.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This book is a must read for anyone on a keto diet. It helps so much if you understand precisely what is going on in your body.</p>

<p><strong>Like:</strong> you lack potassium, but the cause is not that you eat too little of it. You could eat it in concentrated form and still lack it, because you body can’t absorb it because of a lack of salt.</p>

<p>Which is why <strong>my one tip</strong> is: <em>If you are going low/no-carb, then you should drink a pint of salty vegetable broth every day. It will provide you with salt, and the water will help you eat less as well.</em></p>
