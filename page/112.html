    <h1 id="dear-britain">Dear Britain,</h1>

<p>I want to tell you a story; a joke really. A joke that has turned sour in our collective mouths. You see I’m from Austria. My grandfather told me this joke when I was younger and it stuck with me. It’s a joke that is quite dated as it stems from my grandfather’s youth in the 1920s and 1930s.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Teacher:</strong> Class, can you name three of the most important scientists and cultural luminaries of Austria?<br />
<strong>Student:</strong> Does it have to be a goy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does this joke from before WWII tell me who was born in the last quarter of the 20th century?</p>

<p>It tells me that Austria used to be rich! Rich in culture, rich in science, rich in philosophy! Rich because the Jews of Austria brought to it their own cultural heritage and influences to make for a unique and exciting collage that made Austria better.</p>

<p>And then a spiteful xenophobe from Austria went to Germany to bring his brand of hatred to the fore. He came back to Austria in 1938 and was welcomed as its saviour. He was still welcomed when he began to systematically slaughter more than 6 million Jews and anyone else that did not fit his ideal. Many joined him in his savagery.</p>

<p>In the end he was defeated, but his insanity, shared by many, left a scar on Europe that is still visible, that still hurts, today. It left Austria poorer. Poorer not of finances as that was quickly overcome, but poorer of culture, of science, of philosophy.</p>

<p>Today there are very few Jews left in Austria. And the few that remain still attempt to remain inconspicuous lest some old time hate mongers or their mental descendants attack them again. They know there would be little help or protection were that to occur.</p>

<p>Britain is nowhere near as hateful as Austria in the 30s and 40s, but even though there is a pervasive air of anti-semitism that is beginning to trigger Jewish flight instincts. No one expects another holocaust or pogroms - least of all in Britain, but the basic ingredient of hatred is there.</p>

<p>Britain has an exciting and colourful culture influenced by the many people that flocked to it from all corners of the empire. Imagine a London where you could not get a decent curry, because there are no Indians because they fled. That is what Austria feels like today and it is what Britain will feel like if it does not protect its minorities and sheds its anti-semitism and xenophobia. That is what Britain will feel like if it concedes ground to sentiments like “Britain for the British”.</p>

<p>Britain has a long history of absorbing new influences and taking the best out of them to make it its own. Keep that tradition and live by it; don’t let haters of any stripe control Britains destiny.</p>

    <p>Are gods really gods if no one believes in them anymore?</p>

<p>Zeus takes walks in the rain and tries to talk up joggers in central park. When they bolt, or only return his advances with polite smiles that look like fence posts too high for even him to jump, he sighs. He tells them he is a god, and his words echo back to him, accompanied by laughter. No one believes him</p>

<p>He picks up his wife, who might be his sister in this time, in a beat up car with a beautiful flame job, Hera is a marriage counselor with peacock feather bags under her eyes, her advice falls on her own deaf ears as her jealous eyes roam over every girl they pass, and she is right to. She knows this. She has always known.</p>

<p>Poseidon’s hands are rough and calloused, he raises cargo too heavy for a man his age, the young ones say. He laughs his fisherman’s laugh, all depths and riptide, because no one should be his age. He reminds himself he is one of the lucky ones, he gets to be around what he loves. He may not have his dominion any more, but salt water and sun still weather his face.</p>

<p>Hades stalks the streets at night, women cross the street to avoid him, and he smiles with his needle-teeth, they are right to. This winter he is without a bride, and he still wants to usher souls into the afterlife, the pistol hangs heavy in his pocket, his tongue glints gold, the coin to pay his Charon, his most loyal employee. He brings knives to gunfights and guns to fistfights, he stands with his arms out like their new God, these fickle humans, he welcomes the bullets. He dares them to kill him. They try.</p>

<p>Ares and Athena spit curses laced with whiskey from across dive bar floors, they are moving human pawns across a chessboard. They were strategists before they were gangsters, but it doesn’t matter now.</p>

<p>Apollo sings in a nightclub, his crooning voice from a forgotten time. He has his sister’s blood under his fingernails, from stitching up wound after wound, Artemis forgets she is not invincible anymore. He sings about the moon and wonders where she is, picking a fight with some would-be rapist, maybe it’s Zeus. It’s probably Zeus. Again.</p>

<p>Dionysus drinks away their shared pain, dealing LSD in dark alleyways, he whispers sweet promises and his followers believe him, he was human once and he can be again, like wine, he knew nothing so sweet could have lasted forever. Icarus sidles up to his side, asking if he’s got anything that can make you feel like you can fly. In this life, he is a junkie, and Daedalus watches with ancient, sad eyes. Icarus is melting and Dionysus is letting him.</p>

<p>Hestia sits by the hearth and waits for her family to come home. And she listens while they all curse their immortality. She shakes her head slow and clicks her tongue, I know, my darlings, I know.</p>

<p>Are gods really gods if no one believes in them anymore?</p>

<p>Does it matter?</p>
