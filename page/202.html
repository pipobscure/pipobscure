    <p>At 19, I read a sentence that re-terraformed my head: “The level of matter in the universe has been constant since the Big Bang.”<br />
In all the aeons we have lost nothing, we have gained nothing - not a speck, not a grain, not a breath. The universe is simply a sealed, twisting kaleidoscope that has reordered itself a trillion trillion trillion times over.<br />
Each baby, then, is a unique collision - a cocktail, a remix - of all that has come before: made from molecules of Napoleon and stardust and comets and whale tooth; colloidal mercury and Cleopatra’s breath: and with the same darkness that is between the stars between, and inside, our own atoms.<br />
When you know this, you suddenly see the crowded top deck of the bus, in the rain, as a miracle: this collection of people is by way of a starburst constellation. Families are bright, irregular-shaped nebulae. Finding a person you love is like galaxies colliding. We are all peculiar, unrepeatable, perambulating micro-universes - we have never been before and we will never be again. Oh God, the sheer exuberant, unlikely face of our existences. The honour of being alive. They will never be able to make you again. Don’t you dare waste a second of it thinking something better will happen when it ends. Don’t you dare.</p>

  <p>I’m a cast member (employee) at one of the US Disney Parks. Every year when the local anime conventions come into town we have a problem. Cosplayers love to come to the park and try to cosplay in the park.</p>

  <p>WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS.<br />
WE DO NOT ALLOW ANYONE OVER THE AGE OF 10 IN…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, this is so wrong I don’t quite know where to begin:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>You cannot allow this?</em><br />
Well actually you could if you wanted to, but you don’t so you won’t. But don’t you dare to tell people you cannot!</li>
  <li>Intellectual Property is not the reason!<br />
Because you do not own it!. As a matter of fact many characters like “Sleeping Beauty” or “Pocahontas” are in the public domain. What Disney does own id the copyright to the specific expression of that character as portrayed in film and merchandise. No cosplayer could even aspire to be so real (i.e. 2 dimensional) as to infringe on Disney copyright, which leaves trademarks, but those are about brand confusion and require there to be a competing and mistakable product.</li>
  <li>It’s for the kids?<br />
Really, because a kid following someone around in an amusement park where there are security people and cameras covering every inch is really more of a problem than some jerk arresting “Belle”?</li>
  <li>Your managers have started arresting people?<br />
Your f***ing managers cannot arrest anyone. The most they can do is ask someone to leave Disney property. That’s it. No arrests or anything of the like involved.</li>
  <li>Just because you portray a Disney character in a park, does not make you a moral authority of any kind.<br />
As a matter of fact, I am asserting, that the Disney policy to disallow anyone over the age of 10 in costume is wrong. In my eyes it’s actually reprehensible.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>PSA for Disney: Disallowing Cosplayers at Parks. Don’t think you’re awesome</strong></p>

<p>P.S.: Just if you are wondering: I am not into cosplaying myself but I do enjoy watching people do so.</p>

<p>My wife never used to wear nail polish. One of her reasons was that she disliked doing her nails, because she always messed up.</p>

<p>Then about 5 years ago, I did my own nails with black polish for my ghoul costume. Thing is, I was quicker and the results were better. Now she wears nail polish more often and I get to spend my evenings and weekends doing her nails.</p>

<p>I guess it’s true what they say: never let anyone see you having skills at something you do not absolutely live doing, or you’ll be doing it for the rest of your life.</p>

    <p>I guarantee you, the woman has packed all her stuff, plus her kids’ stuff, plus all the shit her husband forgot to pack. Five minutes into their vacation, dude will be cursing because he forgot something important, and his wife will be like, “Here it is. I thought you’d need it, so I packed it, along with all of your underwear, socks, swimsuit, toothbrush, and deodorant because apparently you confused our family trip to Disney World with an overnight couple’s stay at a nudist colony. <em>You’re welcome</em>.”</p>

    <p>Laugh it up, assholes. Without us, you’d be wearing the same underwear three days straight, including poolside.</p>
