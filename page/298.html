<p>Dear LinkedIn,</p>

<p>it’s bad enough if someone I barely know wants me to join your totally overrated site and hands you my e-mail address for that purpose. I am punishing people who do so on my own, but if you then keep sending me reminders of this, it’s you being obnoxious.</p>

<p>What you have achieved with this is that I will never ever join LinkedIn for any reason what-so-ever, and that I will start informing people of your obnoxious behaviour.</p>

<p>Please provide a link in you invite e-mails that enable me to inform you never ever to send e-mail ever again.</p>

<p>Kind regards, Philipp Dunkel</p>

<p>P.S.: <strong>I hereby give notice to anyone on the planet of the fact, that if you send me a LinkedIn invite, any relationship we might have had will remain theoretical and I reserve the right to send up to 1e9 e-mails with random content to you, basically sending your mail-program into oblivion.</strong></p>

    <h1 id="ghost-doa-i-hope">Ghost: D.o.A. (i hope)</h1>

<p><a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a> touts itself as “just a blogging platform” and that’s a good thing. When I heard the announcement at the beginning of the year, I was psyched. Finally something a bit more sensible to replace Wordpress. And then Ghost was released.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/klearchos/3916626559/" title="Beware of the Ghost! by Klearchos Kapoutsis, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3534/3916626559_ed021e944c_z.jpg" alt="Beware of the Ghost!" /></a></p>

<p>I had a long look at it and did a code-review, and in the end I have to say it’s dead on arrival, or at least I hope it will be.</p>

<p>The idea of doing a simple “just blogging” platform is great, and the UI thoughts are great as well, but the actual implementation is horrific. Yes they abandoned PHP in favour of NodeJS to gain some hype, and good on them.</p>

<p>But they basically took all the mistakes that were made implementing Wordpress and reimplemented them using NodeJS. They built a monolith that pretends to be modular, without actually understanding what modular means. <em>shudder</em> They mixed concerns like crazy, made it pretty much impossible to embed it into something larger, and on and on. Every architectural mistake made by Wordpress has been repeated. And in return you don’t event get the one single redeeming feature of Wordpress: its eco-system.</p>

<p>The thing I fear though is that it will be successful. Because if this thing actually takes of, it will be the replacement for Wordpress and therefore disincentivise the creation of alternatives an thereby prolong the suffering. If it dies a quiet death, chances improve that something decent may actually be built to replace Wordpress, ‘cause Ghost ain’t it.</p>

<p>P.S.: I normally don’t like writing such negative posts about other people’s hard work, but this just makes me sad. I guess with great hope comes great disappointment.</p>

    <p>You’re allowed to believe in a god. You’re allowed to believe unicorns live in your shoes for all I care.

The day you start involving the unicorns in making decisions for this country and this world. I have a <strong>big</strong> problem with you.</p>

  <p>They share much more than a first name. Both pivoted from spectacular first acts to second careers devoted to tackling some of the biggest problems on the planet. To do this, they have capitalized on their previous roles, their connections, and their brainpower.</p>
