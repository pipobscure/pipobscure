      <p>‚Ä¶..I am on the verge of being suspended from my one job‚Ä¶..</p>

      <p>because‚Ä¶.</p>

      <p>a woman complained to both my manager and the store manager and the assistant store manager that I was being rude and ignoring her while I was on till and cashing her through because I wasn‚Äôt talking to her when she was talking to me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>

      <p>I‚Äôm Deaf.¬†</p>

      <p>I have a sticker that I can put on my till and a pin that I put on my uniform that says DEAF so that people know. The packer who was packing up her groceries told her I was Deaf and her response to him was¬†‚ÄòShe should learn to listen better if she is going to work in the service industry.‚Äô My packer then tried to continue to explain to which the lady told him that it was still my responsibility to have a conversation with her if she wanted one and that instead of watching the screen to see if her groceries scanned through I should listen to the beeps that way I can talk to her.¬†</p>

      <p>3 times my packer explained to her that I physically am unable to hear and no matter what I won‚Äôt be able to pay attention to both what she is trying to tell me and to the computer to make sure all the groceries went through.¬†</p>

      <p>And still she complained.¬†</p>

      <p>And now because she complained to both the store managers and the front end manager they might have to put me on suspension for 3 days because of it.¬†</p>

      <p>What fucking bullshit audist society do we live in?????</p>

    <p>Hell fucking no.</p>

    <p>A lawsuit waiting to happen.</p>

  <p>Take em out, dear.<br />
You don‚Äôt deserve that bullshit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have them tell her that she is in fact not entitled to a conversation from you or anyone else. If she wants someone to listen to her babbling there is a professional she can go to. They are called talk therapists. And they can also help her with that personality issue at the same time.</p>

I‚Äôve been riding my Royal Enfield Bullet for about a week now. Here are a fee things I have learned:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Check your tyre-pressure religiously. Low pressure will lead to the inner tube moving and then rip the valve off. (No worries though, provided you have a nee tube, some tools and some elbow and tyre grease, you can actually fix it easily.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never trust the previous owner‚Äôs engine oil recommendations. He recommended using regular 20w40 synthetic. I checked the manual and it actually wants 20/50 mineral oil. Thankfully he only put a few hundred miles on it and was good in terms of oil changes. However after filling it with the correct oil, there is a notable sound difference. It actually sounds much healthier.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you know how, a bullet will start on the first kick. Always. (provided its points are set right, ‚Ä¶) Just make sure your cylinder is just past top dead centre (the ammeter helps) and give it a complete turn over.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The best way to check if your fuel valve is working is to keep it turned off. Your engine will cut out just as you want to leave a traffic light.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don‚Äôt go too heavy on the throttle at startup, you will flood your carburettor. (No worries though, just open it up and empty it out. That‚Äôs what tools are for.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you have the right (chilled) mindset this thing is the most fun on two wheels it‚Äôs possible to have.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Youtube is a gigantic resource for finding stuff out about how things work. Just vet the info via manuals and other sources.</p>

</ol>
