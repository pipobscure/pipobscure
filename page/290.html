I find the difference in attitude in differing times fascinating.</p>

<p>If you look at the building at the left, it is elaborately decorated even though it is a simple building of no special stature. It is optimised to be pleasing to the eye for the passer-by.</p>

    <p>Who knows what could happen in the long term? Uber could start using self-driving cars made by Google (one of its investors) to eliminate the need for human drivers, driving down its costs even more. It could introduce a near-instantaneous delivery service to rival Amazon’s drones. It could roll out a subscription service, akin to Amazon Prime, that would include perks like predictive transportation, so that, for example, when Uber sees an appointment on your Google calendar for a cross-town meeting, it sends a car to your office automatically at the right time …</p>

<p>The result of Uber’s efforts, in other words, could be the creation of a techno-metropolis, in which people and goods are ferreted around seamlessly and, perhaps, automatically. It would be like something out of a sci-fi movie.</p>

<p>Now there is a value proposal. Uber might actually add value to the world, something I have never heard anyone propose of facebook. The best I have heard said of facebook is that it might add more advertisement to the world.</p>

<p>Two year anniversary of Christopher Hitchens’ death. I think I’m going to spend some time watching old youtube clips of debates and interviews. He was one brilliant and brilliantly funny man.</p>

  <p>Why is the queen of England on Canadian money?</p>

  <p>Because England basically raised Canada until we were old enough to make our own decisions.</p>

  <p>America left home super early and made bad life choices as a result.</p>

Saw this “Hungarian Specialty” today and got my wife one.</p>

<p><strong>Pure poison</strong></p>

<p>The ingredients are basically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>water, salt &amp; yeast</li>
  <li>white flour (i.e.: pure carbs)</li>
  <li>massive amounts sugar (i.e.: even purer carbs)</li>
  <li>butter &amp; cinnamon</li>
</ul>

<p>basically I think I have overindulged and gone off keto just by looking at the damn thing.</p>

<p><em>These types of bakery items are the only time I actually miss eating carbs somewhat. It passes quite quickly though</em></p>

<p>P.S.: Tonight we are going out for Hungarian food, which is basically fried fat in lard, served with grease. It’s going to be delicious.</p>
