  <p>Compared to landing a job at Wal-Mart, getting into the Ivy Leagues is a cakewalk.</p>

<p>So I guess if you are really competitive you’ll now apply to Wal-Mart instead of Harvard</p>

    <h1 id="temporary-e-mail-addresses-the-how-and-why">Temporary E-Mail Addresses: The how and why</h1>

<p>I recently offered someone at the other end of the world coffee. After all: friends don’t let friends drink bad coffee. Since that person is on the other end of the world, I was thinking Starbucks gift card. Well they do that, except they need an email address to send the voucher to.</p>

<p>So at that point I asked for their email address. I had no interest in actually getting their email address. I don’t really know them after all, but I do enjoy their blog and wanted to send them a gift card.</p>

<p>Well that’s over and it didn’t work out, which is fine, but it got me thinking about avoiding handing out email addresses, be it to sites you register with or to people you don’t know. And I realised that not everyone knows how to get a temporary e-mail address for that purpose.</p>

<p>So here comes my <strong>“Public Service Announcement”</strong>:</p>

<p>There are actually services out there like <a href="https://meltmail.com/">MeltMail</a>, where you enter your real email address, and they will give you an email address that will work for anywhere between 3 hours and a day. Alternatively you could use <a href="http://getairmail.com/">AirMail</a> which works as long as you keep your browser window open.</p>

<p>It really is that simple. While it’s not protecting your identity, against molochs such as the NSA, it is sufficient to protect you against spam and random stalkers. So play with it and see what mischief you can create ;)</p>

<p>I’ve been rewatching “Being Erica”, a Canadian TV series. It’s basically a story about this totally crazy woman that meets a time-travelling psychoanalyst. She goes back to key points in her life in an attempt to find out how to fix things she regrets. And while that works sometimes, others it doesn’t quite work as well.</p>

<p>It’s the stereotypical “Chic-TV” and I absolutely love it! Of course that might be because it is an inspiration to reflect about how to get a grip on my own life.</p>

<p>Any case, this is the theme-song for the series. It’s by Lily Frost whom I discovered due to the series. And have totally fallen in love with. Her music is awesome.</p>

<p>Any case, you should all go listen to some Lily Frost. And when she has gotten into the mood, reflect a bit on your life and realise that it’s pretty amazing. Now what are you going to make of it? I for one will throw myself into it and enjoy the hell out of it!</p>
