  <blockquote>
    <p>Hey everyone! This is just a quick message to all my UK followers over the age of 18: <strong>don’t forget to vote today.</strong> Your vote can make a difference and it is important for young people to have their say in how our country is governed. </p>

    <p>Don’t think it will make a difference? Last time there was a general election, I was 15 years old and on the brink of sitting my GCSEs. I could barely wrap my head around starting A-Levels, but I knew that a university education might be on the cards for me a few years down the line. Fast forward to today, and I’m 2 weeks away from finishing my undergraduate degree which I have been studying for since Autumn 2012. <strong>As a result of the previous general election in 2010, I now pay triple the amount of tuition fees than students who entered the year before me.</strong> The election matters.</p>

    <p>My point is the election <em>does</em> matter and we can have a say in that through our votes. When I vote today, I know first that politics has a direct influence on my life, my work and my education. Please, if you’re registered to vote, head down to your designated polling station before 10pm today (7th May 2015) and cast your vote. Thank you.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Yes, please do vote if you are eligible and registered!</p>

  <p>This is my second general election and fourth election overall, so I guess I’m kinda a keen (and old) voter but it is SO important!</p>

  <p>The number of people who don’t vote out numbers the number of people who vote for any one of the big parties.</p>

  <p>Imagine what could change if nonvoters started to vote!</p>

  <p>And seeing as nonvoters tend to be young people, things could change in our favour!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Plus if you don’t vote when you could I think you loose your right to bitch about anything in the country!</p>

    <h1 id="oh-no-i-have-to-go-to-work-tomorrow">Oh no I have to go to work tomorrow…</h1>

<p>… is something I hear over and over again. And truth be told I don’t get it. If that’s your attitude to work, how do you expect anything good to ever come of it?</p>

<p>Let me tell you something, the single thing, that all successful people have in common: they all like what they are doing.</p>

<p>Now I get that “being successful” may not be the best measurement, after all it leaves out a whole lot of stuff.</p>

<p>So let’s look at it from a totally different angle. The socialist ideal held that you should spend 8 hours of every day with work, 8 with leisure and 8 with sleep. If you take away the sleep time, where you are more or less unconscious then that leaves you with spending HALF your waking hours working.</p>

<p>And that’s under ideal circumstances! In modern reality it’s probably even more. So if you are spending more than half your waking hours at something you dislike, then that’s a problem.</p>

<p>Of course I realise that there are external pressures that force us all to maybe do things we don’t like. But still if this is a persistent theme, it’s a problem. If you ever want a chance to actually like your life, if ever you want a chance to actually be happy, you better find a way to enjoy working by whatever means.</p>

<p>One thing is for certain: “oh no I have to go to work tomorrow” is a recipe for failing at happiness whatever else you do.</p>

      <p>How Do Court Reporters Keep Straight Faces?</p>

      <p>These are from a book called Disorder in the Courts and are things people actually said in court, word for word, taken down and published by court reporters that had the torment of staying calm while the exchanges were taking place.</p>

      <p>ATTORNEY: What was the first thing your husband said to you that morning?<br />
WITNESS: He said, ‘Where am I, Cathy?’<br />
ATTORNEY: And why did that upset you?<br />
WITNESS: My name is Susan!<br />
_______________________________<br />
ATTORNEY: What gear were you in at the moment of the impact?<br />
WITNESS: Gucci sweats and Reeboks.<br />
____________________________________________<br />

WITNESS: No, I just lie there.<br />
____________________________________________<br />
ATTORNEY: What is your date of birth?<br />
WITNESS: July 18th.<br />
ATTORNEY: What year?<br />
WITNESS: Every year.<br />
_____________________________________<br />
ATTORNEY: How old is your son, the one living with you?<br />
WITNESS: Thirty-eight or thirty-five, I can’t remember which.<br />
ATTORNEY: How long has he lived with you?<br />
WITNESS: Forty-five years.<br />
_________________________________<br />
ATTORNEY: This myasthenia gravis, does it affect your memory at all?<br />
WITNESS: Yes.<br />
ATTORNEY: And in what ways does it affect your memory?<br />
WITNESS: I forget..<br />
ATTORNEY: You forget? Can you give us an example of something you forgot?<br />
___________________________________________<br />
ATTORNEY: Now doctor, isn’t it true that when a person dies in his sleep, he doesn’t know about it until the next morning?<br />
WITNESS: Did you actually pass the bar exam?<br />
____________________________________</p>

      <p>ATTORNEY: The youngest son, the 20-year-old, how old is he?<br />
WITNESS: He’s 20, much like your IQ.<br />
___________________________________________<br />
ATTORNEY: Were you present when your picture was taken?<br />
WITNESS: Are you shitting me?<br />
_________________________________________<br />
ATTORNEY: So the date of conception (of the baby) was August 8th?<br />
WITNESS: Yes.<br />
ATTORNEY: And what were you doing at that time?<br />
WITNESS: Getting laid<br />
____________________________________________</p>

      <p>ATTORNEY: She had three children , right?<br />
WITNESS: Yes.<br />
ATTORNEY: How many were boys?<br />
WITNESS: None.<br />
ATTORNEY: Were there any girls?<br />
WITNESS: Your Honor, I think I need a different attorney. Can I get a new attorney?<br />
____________________________________________<br />
ATTORNEY: How was your first marriage terminated?<br />
WITNESS: By death..<br />
ATTORNEY: And by whose death was it terminated?<br />
WITNESS: Take a guess.<br />
___________________________________________</p>

      <p>ATTORNEY: Can you describe the individual?<br />
WITNESS: He was about medium height and had a beard<br />
ATTORNEY: Was this a male or a female?<br />
WITNESS: Unless the Circus was in town I’m going with male.<br />
_____________________________________<br />
ATTORNEY: Is your appearance here this morning pursuant to a deposition notice which I sent to your attorney?<br />
WITNESS: No, this is how I dress when I go to work.<br />
______________________________________<br />
ATTORNEY: Doctor , how many of your autopsies have you performed on dead people?<br />
WITNESS: All of them. The live ones put up too much of a fight.<br />
_________________________________________<br />
ATTORNEY: ALL your responses MUST be oral, OK? What school did you go to?<br />
WITNESS: Oral…<br />
_________________________________________<br />
ATTORNEY: Do you recall the time that you examined the body?<br />
WITNESS: The autopsy started around 8:30 PM<br />
ATTORNEY: And Mr. Denton was dead at the time?<br />
WITNESS: If not, he was by the time I finished.<br />
____________________________________________<br />
ATTORNEY: Are you qualified to give a urine sample?<br />
WITNESS: Are you qualified to ask that question?</p>

      <p>______________________________________<br />
And last:</p>

      <p>ATTORNEY: Doctor, before you performed the autopsy, did you check for a pulse?<br />
WITNESS: No.<br />
ATTORNEY: Did you check for blood pressure?<br />
WITNESS: No.<br />
ATTORNEY: Did you check for breathing?<br />
WITNESS: No..<br />
ATTORNEY: So, then it is possible that the patient was alive when you began the autopsy?<br />
WITNESS: No.<br />
ATTORNEY: How can you be so sure, Doctor?<br />
WITNESS: Because his brain was sitting on my desk in a jar.<br />
ATTORNEY: I see, but could the patient have still been alive, nevertheless?<br />
WITNESS: Yes, it is possible that he could have been alive and practicing law.</p>

      <p>not voting isn’t refusing to play the game. You’re in this country, you’re subject to the game whether you like it or not. The only way not to play is to leave, and the vast majority of us don’t have that option.</p>

      <p>**Not voting is playing the game but saying ‘pass’ every time your turn comes up and then wondering why you lost.<br />
**</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Making young people not vote is actually a tactic used in politics to keep the satus quo. The young vote is always the one for change, so dissuading them from voting at all is actually a political tactic used by the people in charge to keep themselves there.</p>

    <p>Voting is rebellion.</p>

  <p>Choosing to not vote (not being able to for pretty much any reason is a different story) does nothing but give your permission to establish a dictatorship.</p>
