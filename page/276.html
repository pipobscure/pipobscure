    <p>Let’s face it - English is a crazy language. There is no egg in eggplant nor ham in hamburger; neither apple nor pine in pineapple. English muffins weren’t invented in England or French fries in France. Sweetmeats are candies while sweetbreads, which aren’t sweet, are meat. We take English for granted. But if we explore its paradoxes, we find that quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square and a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig.</p>

<p>And why is it that writers write but fingers don’t fing, grocers don’t groce and hammers don’t ham? If the plural of tooth is teeth, why isn’t the plural of booth beeth? One goose, 2 geese. So one moose, 2 meese? One index, 2 indices? Doesn’t it seem crazy that you can make amends but not one amend? If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all but one of them, what do you call it?</p>

<p>If teachers taught, why didn’t preachers praught? If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat? In what language do people recite at a play and play at a recital? Ship by truck and send cargo by ship? Have noses that run and feet that smell? How can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same, while a wise man and a wise guy are opposites?</p>

<p>You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your house can burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a form by filling it out and in which an alarm goes off by going on. English was invented by people, not computers, and it reflects the creativity of the human race (which, of course, isn’t a race at all). That is why, when the stars are out, they are visible, but when the lights are out, they are invisible.</p>

<p>I love this language with a passion!</p>

  <p>Some days I do love, love, love my job.</p>

  <p>Other days, I wonder why I put so much effort in when other members of staff come in completely fucked off their face on drink, not putting any effort in and not meeting their pillars/targets &amp; nothing gets said.</p>

  <p>I take pride in my work, I want to move up within the company, so I hope that when it comes down to it, my efforts are recognised.</p>

<p>I have a policy of never speaking to people about problems such as this in front of others. It may well be that something is being said, just not in front of you.</p>

<p>And if not, you can imagine that there is and feel better instantly :)</p>

    <h1 id="smokey-café">Smokey Café</h1>

<p>Today I placed myself for the first time since August, when I stopped smoking, in a café where I used to do a lot of work. I grabbed my Laptop and started hacking. Throughout the day, the café got smokier and smokier, a fact that I had never previously noticed.</p>

<p>Today it turned so bad that I actually had to leave because I couldn’t breathe anymore. Now I’m wondering: has it always been like that?</p>

<p>Probably yes. So I guess I won’t be going back anytime soon. I can’t believe I was ever able to handle that.</p>

  <p>Inspired by <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/fuck-everything-were-doing-five-blades,11056/">the escalating blade count</a> of the razor industry, Nabisco <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/nabisco-snack-physicists-develop-highly-unstable-q,34421">has developed a new snack</a> called the Quadriscuit.</p>

    <p>“At the moment, this hyperwafer can only exist for six milliseconds in a precisely calibrated field of magnetic energy, positrons, roasted garlic, and beta particles,” lab chief Dr. Paul Ellison told reporters at a press conference outside Nabisco’s $200 million seven-whole-grain accelerator.</p>

  <p>The last line of the piece made me LOL for real. (thx, <a href="https://twitter.com/megnut">meg</a>)</p>
