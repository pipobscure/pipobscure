This narrative – which is not afforded to people of color – feeds into the assumption that incidents like what happened at Emanuel AME Church are isolated tragedies executed by lone gunmen. Essentially, it excuses the system that allows racialized terrorism to keep happening.</p>

<p>I just found out that my driving license will no longer be valid in Britain after August 9th because back in 1994 I took my driving test in the U.S.</p>

<p>So I’ll have to go and take the theoretical and practical exam and get a British license.</p>

<p>In all likelihood the person administering my exams will have been alive for fewer years than I have been driving. Now that’s what I call silly!</p>
