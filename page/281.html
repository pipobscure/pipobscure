<p>So awesome. Sitting in a cafe across the table from a family, where he is a native French speaker, she is a native Spanish speaker, the daughter is obviously growing up speaking mostly German, and the couple communicate with each other in English.</p>

    <p><strong>Death Announcement</strong></p>

    <p>Dr. Sigmund Suitzer, royal empirial judicial councilor, and Mrs. Therese Blum announce in their own name as well as those of all nieces and neffews in deepest sorrow the news of the death of his beloved sister (and aunt)</p>

    <p><strong>Babette Beer</strong><br />
<em>widow of a royal empirial professor and gubernatorial councilor</em></p>

    <p>who on Friday the 27th of February 1885 at 3 o’clock in the afternoon after lengthy suffering in her 75th year slipped from life into eternal peace. The funeral will take place on Sunday the 1st of March in the morning at half past 9 at the mourning house at Pillersdorfgasse 6 (11th district), just past the central cemetery (Israelite section).</p>

    <p><em>this is instead of distinct personal notification</em></p>

    <hr />

    <p>—-</p>

    <p>And yes the whole thing is basically one single sentence with innumerable sub-clauses. But it’s gorgeous.</p>

    <p>P.S.: royal and empirial whatever is an honorary title achieved by doing any job long enough, and not an actual role.</p>

    <p>P.P.S.: these people obviously lived in Vienna, Austria at a time before WWI when antisemitism was less pronounced than at any later time.</p>

  <p>Neat! Thank you for the translation. :)</p>

<p>I love history and eclectic research, so I tried a search of the relevant names in the cemetary records (they are on the internet). Sadly nothing can be learned there.</p>

<p>However we do know that on the 9th of November 1938 the Nazis destroyed one mourning hall and defaced another in the jewish section of the central cemetary. They also ransacked many of the graves, Babette Beer’s final resting place likely among them. If that were not enough, the final battles for Vienna in 1945 were fought between the Russion and German armies on the grounds of the cemetary. So while i was tempted to actually go and find her grave (it’s actually also a beautiful park to wander in), I think I’ll desist.</p>
