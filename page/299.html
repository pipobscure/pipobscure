    <p>I’ve been fighting for now 14 years to try to do this, to make all the subway turnstiles make music. I want to make every station in New York have a different set of dominant keys, so that people when they grow up, later on in life, will hear a piece of music and be like, “Oh that’s Union Square.”</p>

<p>So when you go through the turnstiles, there would be a thing that would make a beep of a certain note. And it would have a random note generator that would be based on a percentage, so that the root note would be a higher percentage of going off, then the third, then the fifth. And during rush hour in the bigger stations, it would hopefully make a really beautiful piece of music.</p>

<p>Each line would be a piece. The green line would go through different chords and when they intersected with other lines that would change that station.</p>

<p>[This would be so epic.]</p>

  <p>“<strong>LDL cholesterol is <em>calculated</em>, not measured</strong>. The Friedewald calculation, developed in the early 1960s to provide an easy but crude means of estimating the quantity of cholesterol in the low-density lipoprotein fraction of the blood appled several basic assumptions…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>…that are basically all proven to be incorrect. Therefore your LDL values are very likely irrelevant.</p>

  <p>Taxation has been abolished, the government has been privatized, and employees take the surname of the company they work for. It’s a brave new corporate world…</p>

<p>… and it’s an awesome book I just reread. It is the alternative history to 1984. What if it’s not government that goes crazy, but corporations?</p>

<p>It’s what would have happened if Ayn Rand had gotten her way. And it makes for an enticing story.</p>
