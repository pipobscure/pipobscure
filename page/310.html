<p>The Atlantic published an Article titled <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/07/the-hole-in-our-collective-memory-how-copyright-made-mid-century-books-vanish/278209/">The Hole in Our Collective Memory</a> at the end of July. The article by <a href="https://twitter.com/beccarosen">Rebecca Rosen</a> presents a <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2290181">study about the availability of copyrighted works</a> from different decades.</p>

<p>According to the article the study comes to the conclusion, that copyright law causes books that are still under copyright protection to be more likely to be out of print than those in the public domain.</p>

<p>The conclusion from that is that copyright owners are not in fact monetizing the works they own, but rather let them fade into obscurity my not making them available. So while there is no profit from them being made, society is also loosing out on them because intellectual substance is locked away.</p>

<p>Here is to hope that we can reverse at least some of the current state of IP-Stupidity by using studies like this. After all, this basically proves that the current copyright law achieves the opposite of what was intended when the original copyright laws were passed.</p>

<p>Maybe we need to do the same thing for patents. After all, many have realised that the current patent regime harms innovation rather than fuelling it. If we could actually scientifically prove this realisation, maybe we have a chance of making some changes there as well.</p>

<p>Very interesting piece on teens, the internet and privacy. It sort of reinforces the idea that online privacy isn’t really an issue for the next generation as it is for the generation that is currently 18+</p>

<p>A lot of the media seem to be appalled that there is a <a href="http://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2013/ccc-breaks-apple-touchid">way around the iPhone-5S fingerprint scanner</a>. It gets a lot of media play, but for all the wrong reasons. The CCC did a pretty good job explaining their aim:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics. It is plain stupid to use something that you can´t change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token”, said Frank Rieger, spokesperson of the CCC. “The public should no longer be fooled by the biometrics industry with false security claims.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But then they go of the deep end and talk about biometric passports? That’s basically just ideological fluff that, while potentially valid, demeans the good statement they were making:</p>

<p>Do not believe that a fingerprint is the ultimate in security. It’s more like the child-proofing of a medicine bottle: it works against children and is useless against (most) adults.</p>

<p>The fingerprint scanner on the iPhone is the same thing. It keeps people without a lot of motivation out. For those with the know-how and the motivation there is a system to deal with it. It’s called remote wipe. And if even that is insufficient then you should probably not have your data on you phone.</p>

<p>The thing to realise is that security is not an absolute and it’s not about a technology or a product. Security means different things for different situations. It’s about a use case and the risks associated with that use-case.</p>

<p>We have to question what we want to achieve. It’s definitely not preventing determined criminals from accessing our phone data. It’s to prevent easy access to that data when we leave our phone on our desk when we step away.</p>

<p>So when you think about security, you need to think about what it is you need/want; you need to look at your use-case.</p>

<p><strong>Stupid Analogy</strong></p>

<p><em>I love to come up with analogies. Often they turn out stupid. This is one of those. However they usually do contain a grain of truth and when pondered might actually lead to good insights. I’ll leave this one here in case someone wants to go down a rat-hole for a while</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take contracts as an example. We put squiggly lines on pieces of paper and call it a signature. We accept that as proof of intent to form a contract. And guess what it works most of the time and it’s totally insecure.</p>

  <p>If someone with sufficient motivation wants to do so, he can just put different squiggly lines on the paper than he usually and then claim he never signed after reaping the benefits of the contract. That’s what we call fraud and we made laws against that.</p>

  <p>Thing is, it works well enough for 99.9% of all cases. And for the few cases it doesn’t, we have a system in place to handle it.</p>

    <h1 id="security-in-modules">Security in Modules</h1>

<p>At NodeConf.eu, there was a great talk by @adam_baldwin on node security and the <a href="https://nodesecurity.io">Node-Security Project</a>. After the talk while watching a bunch of nodecopters crash, I got to talking with Adam about security bugs in modules and the fact that he seems to me to be an incorrigible optimist thinking he can actually make things safe. You know the way people talk when they have a beer/cider in hand it it ain’t the first night out ;)</p>

<p>Well Adam made a comment, that I should write a blog-post about it. I said that I’m not really into blogging. Well I’m not, but I try and try again. So this endeavour on tumblr is actually Adam’s fault.</p>

<p>So here goes nothing.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://andrewkelley.me/post/do-not-use-bodyparser-with-express-js.html">Problem with Express/bodyParser</a> was discussed heatedly up and down twitter. (If you missed it, be happy)</p>

<p>I have a problem with the statements made in the article, because it misses the most important point. He writes a short piece of code, and then claims that it’s dangerous. <strong>And he is right</strong> however, I can do the very same thing with any API.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>while (42) setInterval(console.log.bind(console, 'Hallo'), 1)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>is pretty <em>dangerous</em> as well. (Go try it in your node-REPL and come back when you killed it ;) )</p>

<p>The point here is that any API, can be dangerous if you don’t know what you are doing. If you don’t think about what the module you want to use actually does, and don’t think about what you are doing, then well you are never going to write anything that is even remotely secure.</p>

<p>Of course Andrew realises this and he says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can prevent this attack by always checking whether req.files is present for endpoints in which you use bodyParser or multipart, and then deleting the temp files. Note that this is every POST endpoint if you did something like app.use(express.bodyParser()).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which makes it even sadder that he chose the title he did, because it is hyperbole and doesn’t add to the security conversation. What we should be thinking about is how we can get people to educate themselves about what they are doing.</p>

<p>Which is why I love what Adam is doing at the <a href="https://nodesecurity.io">Node-Security Project</a>. This will be a great boon to the NodeJS community.</p>

<p>I recently met @davglass at NodeConf.eu.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Before I get started let me use this space to give a shoutout to @Cianomaidin of <a href="http://www.nearform.com">nearform</a> for putting on one of the best conferences ever.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>anyhow i met this yahoo and he was really bubbling over about the products of this internet dinosaur <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a>. (Love bad puns)</p>

<p>While Yahoo! hasn’t really been the company I would associate with the word “innovative” over the last couple of years, it is a pretty cool story. An internet methusalem, that is pretty spry for its age that is actually still doing pretty cool stuff. (For details about alcoholic software please speak to @davglass)</p>

<p>So I decided to give Yahoo! another shot at getting integrated into my personal toolset. I will write down here every once in a while how the experience goes, but so far i like it.</p>

<p>Yahoo-Mail is a much better fit for how i use E-Mail than GMail ever was. I just had a look at Yahoo-Groups and will try to organize the Viennese NodeJS community using it.</p>

<p>In short, I like what i am seeing. @davglass is an awesome ambassador for Yahoo!</p>

<p>P.S.: I want to be @davglass when I grow up ;)</p>
