<p>I am happy to report that both kids really liked their first day of school. Both have found a few friends already and are happy to go back. So it seems as if school is working out alright.</p>

<p>In other news: I have a sever toothache since Monday. Bad enough that I went to the dentist today. Any case, I have a major infection on one tooth that I had a root canal on about a year ago. It will need recrowning so we are talking a multi visit thing. For now I’m on a course of antibiotics for the infection and pain relievers for the pain. On the 18th I’ll get rid of the old crown and then we’ll see. Yikes, it’s going to be a painful month.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>There will come a time when you want to cut off all your hair. Do it. Realise that the thing you want rid of doesn’t lie in the long curls that frame your face so perfectly. Live with short hair for a while. It’ll grow.</p>

<p>You won’t always want to talk to people. That’s okay. When it’s late and you hear your friends talking in the next room, you don’t have to join them. You’re allowed your solitude. It makes company sweeter and it teaches you how to survive alone. You will need that skill.</p>

<p>In the winter, you’ll believe that nothing will ever grow again. You’re wrong. Every year, London looks like it’s on its last legs, wheezing through those last cold days in March. Every year, spring comes like an explosion and the city shakes off its sleep.</p>

<p>Mundane problems will get the better of you sometimes. Don’t worry. Try as you might, life cannot be an endless, beautiful, intense moment. Find comfort in money worries and late trains; they’re a welcome rest in between heartbreaks and breakdowns.</p>

<p>People will call you a cynic, a wry smile on their faces. Pay them no mind. You alone know that you are capable of a love greater than anything they can comprehend. You alone know that you are not willing to sell your identity and respect to the first smirking halfwit to pass by. It is not cynicism. It is reverence for your own vast and fathomless heart, and it makes sense only to love someone who understands that and is awed by it.</p>

<p>You will not always get what you want when you want it. Accept it. Your goals are not set in stone and you are not on a fixed trajectory. Sometimes, life will take its time and you will have to play the long, interminable game. Play it well and with as much grace as you can muster. Live at your own pace.</p>

<p>At night, you will occasionally wake up afraid, wanting to die. Don’t give in. Night plays its tricks, but you are not so easily fooled. Your mind will play its tricks, too. It will make you believe that you’re not who you are, but you must not give in. You take a breath and you tell yourself that you are here. That you always were.</p>

<p>A kid that wants night vision goggles to read deserves [a book light](<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B004N6UW0K/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_DYmbub035ZA0A">https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B004N6UW0K/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_DYmbub035ZA0A</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I hate when people say money doesn’t buy you happiness. it does. it buys you financial stability, a nice house, nice cars, nice vacations and trips, healthier food, a better education, etc. like wearing burberry while driving around in an audi would probably make me pretty happy too. but it’s just that rich people often take their comfortable lives for granted and end up being spoiled and ungrateful for what they have </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Money doesn’t buy you happiness, but it does relieve you of a lot of existential angst. That in turn leaves you free to pursue happiness. So while money is not a guarantee for happiness (i.e. buys it), it does make it a lot easier to attain.</p>
