<p>You know when someone is doing a million things and getting into total overload, just because of fear and uncertainty about the future? And then they actually miss all the truly relevant things to actually get to have that future? And then they drive you total nuts with getting you to do totally irrelevant stuff just because they are scared? And you like have no idea how to escape that and not let it drown you much less help that person to escape that vicious cycle?</p>

<p>Well that’s how things are right now. No worries, deep breath, it’ll be fine. I am so chill under fire!</p>

  <p>yuuuuuuum</p>

<p>Please just call it what it is! It’s scrambled tofu and fried tempeh.</p>

<p>I’m sure it tastes absolutely delicious and would be delirious to be so under it’s own identity.</p>

<p>Calling it “the vegan alternative to eggs and bacon” is like calling women “the dickless alternative to men”. Now while that might be good for a laugh in a certain crowd, I don’t know any women (or real men for that matter) that would appreciate that.</p>

<p>So please call and appreciate things for what they are and not for what they are sort of like. Tofu actually tastes better when you call it tofu and prepare it like tofu.</p>

<p>Remember those early ’90s fake frankfurter sausages made of tofu? They were disgusting! And they were disgusting mainly because they pretended to be sausages. When tofu stopped pretending to be meat, it started to be appreciated.</p>

<p>(Which would be a great lead in off a rant about how people can only be appreciated when they are themselves, but I’ll stop myself for now)</p>
