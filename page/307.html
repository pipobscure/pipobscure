<p>Shanley wrote an interesting article on <a href="https://medium.com/about-work/c0715b8a7c93">Downfalls of Distributed Startups</a>. I have done distributed and I am currently doing all in one place. There are problems with either and the debate around distributed teams is finally getting to a point where it gets from fanboyism to an actual intellectual debate.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teemus/1306860597/" title="Team meeting by teemus, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1020/1306860597_d3efab1073_n.jpg" alt="Team meeting" /><br />

<p>My experience with distributed teams has been great. When you have all members of a team working from different locations and interacting exclusively online things work really well. There is one big caveat however; the moment there is a location that routinely contains more than one person, the team falls apart.</p>

<p>So the real problem with distributed teams in my view is that it’s an all or nothing proposal. Either you go all in or you leave it be.</p>

<p>Now that doesn’t mean that localised teams are the answer to efficient work. Localised teams have the problem that all this direct interaction causes a lot of distraction, a lot of interruption. I have found that if you have room of developers working on a project they tend to be less efficient because of these interruptions.</p>

<p>The model that I have come to believe is optimal is to have a fully distributed team, that travels to a common location every few months. This picks up some of the advantages of localised teams while keeping the advantages of distributed teams.</p>

    <p>I think satisfying yourself is easier to do than satisfying the audience because the audience is a moving target. I mean, we’re talking about “the audience” but who is the audience, you know what I’m saying? It’s all subjective. You should know no one better than you know yourself, and in being honest with yourself in making the movie, I think you can hit your intended target. Through being honest with yourself and doing something that’s close to you, it’ll connect with other people. They’ll connect with the honesty of it. If you look at a filmmaker’s filmography, their best work is the stuff that was closest to them, where they were trying to hit a target in themselves, not an audience target. I think that’s the difference between making art and making commerce.</p>

<p>“I think satisfying yourself is easier to do than satisfying the audience” sounds a lot like masturbation. Which might not be accidental coming from a film guy. Hmmmmm….</p>

<p>Besides how they have attempted to send women back to the 1950s, this is my second biggest problem with the current Republican Party: active opposition to the advancement of Science (presumably because it conflicts with their religious beliefs).</p>

  <p>Facebook has just announced that it will now allow users under 18 to post publicly. Until today, users aged 17 and under could only post updates that their friends, or in some cases, friends of friends, could see — ostensibly because it helped protect them. The feature likely won’t entice any Facebook-loathing teens into using the service, but creates a level playing field where there wasn’t one before. Now all users will see the same drop-down “audience selector,” which lets you specify who can see each photo or status you post. </p>

<p>Maybe we will finally realise that <a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/53ea514c9ec0">teens know a lot about privacy</a> and we can finally start having a good think about what we actually want to and need to protect children from.</p>

    <h1 id="ios7-safari-private-mode-is-a-failure">iOS7 Safari private mode is a failure</h1>

<p>The private browsing mode in Safari on iOS7 is a failure of engineering so unlike what Apple is known for that they should be ashamed to ship it.</p>

<p>The issue is that it leaves session cookies enabled while it disables sessionStore. And all due to misguided ideas what this stuff can be used for.</p>

<p>I for one use the sessionStore to hold form data until the moment the user actually decides to take my offer and transact with me. in other words, I use the sessionStore to enhance my user’s privacy. And this is made harder by this misguided “feature”.</p>

<p>Private browsing in iOS Safari</p>

<ul>
  <li>is a misnomer: it decreases privacy</li>
  <li>is a miscarriage of engineering: it breaks the browser</li>
  <li>is opaque: not many understand what it does</li>
</ul>

<p>and Apple is seriously pushing this crap? In iOS6 at least it what hidden in the Settings app. Now it is front and center in the tab switcher as one of only 3 buttons.</p>

<p>Apple should remove this feature. It does nothing for privacy, and everything to mess up the web.</p>

<p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>

<h3 id="and-the-market-cannot-compensate">…and the market cannot compensate</h3>

<p>Mathew Ingram wrote a <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/10/07/first-they-came-for-the-mugshot-websites-but-i-said-nothing/">piece on GigaOM</a> about a change in the google search algorithm to discourage mugshot sites and the often associated blackmail.</p>

<p>He makes the case, not least with his title “first they came for the mugshot websites, but I said nothing” that this decision to actively discourage a set of sites is a slippery slope. The danger is that we will not know what will be hidden from us by google next.</p>

Google chooses what we see and don’t see</a></p>

<p>He contrasts the fiction of “the right to be forgotten” that the EU is currently pushing, which would give the end user a choice in what will be remembered, versus Google deciding what will be forgotten by virtue of not being found.</p>

<p>While I find the EU position to be an unrealistic fiction, I find this Google action to be a worrisome precedent. It is of course legitimate for Google, and that’s likely the argument they will put forth, to optimise for deducing the intent of the searcher and giving the best possible results. That is a specious argument though, because whether mugshot sites fit that intent depends on an assumption about intent that is decided on by google. Ultimately, it’s a decision that is made.</p>

<p>The real issue is that the market cannot possibly have a chance to compensate. Usually, one would make the claim that since the filtering is beong done by a corporation and not a state entity, the market has a chance to correct any problems. This however assumes that consumers have an opportunity to notice. In the case of filtering the web consumers will never know precisely because they will not know what they are missing.</p>

<p>Mathew’s worry about what Google will filter next is very valid. When it starts filtering things like Wiki-Leaks, or Snowden’s revelations, that would be a real problem. Especially since we will not know what we did not find and we won’t even know whether Google is filtering due to ideology or due to pressure from one or more states.</p>
