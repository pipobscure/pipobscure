<p>Matt Honan hosts a discussion between Jeff Jarvis (Professor of Journalism) and Chris Paul (Founder of 4Chan).</p>

<p>Very interesting discussion, what they are missing though is  a very important distinction:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Anonymous</strong> - bearing no naming element</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pseudonomous</strong> - bearing a non-canonical name</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Identified</strong> - bearing a canonical name</li>
</ul>

<p>The difference between pseudonymous and anonymous is very important, because pseudonymity provides many of the benefits of identity while still providing many of the advantages of anonymity.</p>

<p>Well worth the half hour it takes.</p>

    <h1 id="why-i-seriously-dislike-coffee-script">Why I seriously dislike Coffee-Script</h1>

<p>I had a conversation last night with one of those coffee-script loving developers and I once again stated that I really dislike coffee-script. Contrary to previous exchanges of this nature this person did something unusual and smart for the breed: he asked WHY?</p>

<p>I laid out some arguments for him and figured I have never done so in a coherent pattern before. So here it goes, the why to my dislike of coffee-script.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/carnesaurus/7166762701/" title="Coffee shouldn't be this complicated. by Carnesaurus, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7230/7166762701_431362ba59_z.jpg" alt="Coffee shouldn't be this complicated." /></a></p>

<p>Whenever you develop a more complex system than a hello world example, you layer a bunch of things on top of each other, use an oodle of modules and paradigms and glue them all together in hopes that they don’t fall apart. You try to help make sure that they don’t by adding tests and using more stuff for that. Simply put:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Complex systems are complex</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This observation seems like a no-brainer and absolutely obvious. It is so obvious, that smart people tend to assume it and forget it. But it really does bear mentioning. The reason it is important is because complex things are hard to understand by their very nature. The more complex something is the harder it is to understand.</p>

<p>Before I continue, we need to agree on the idea that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hard to understand is an undesired property of software</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you disagree here, the rest of the argument will not make sense to you. (You should also probably consider a change of career :( yikes).</p>

<p>The fact that as complexity increases ease of understanding decreases means that we should strive to make our systems as complex as necessary yet as simple as possible. This philosophy is nothing new and nothing I came up with.</p>

<p>If you you followed me to this point, the conclusion should not be a surprise:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since anything that adds complexity to the system is detrimental to its understandability, anything added must provide some significant benefit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not having been surprised, you will likely be asking the same question I have asked when looking as coffee-script: “What significant benefit does coffee-script provide that justifies its addition to the stack?”</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the claim that <a href="http://coffeescript.org">the coffee-script site</a> makes. That means that coffee-script by its very definition of itself is simply syntactic sugar on top of javascript. Syntactic sugar that requires the addition of a compiler to the tool-chain, that has a non-intuitive syntax for someone used to the curly bracket family and that does not eliminate the need to know and be fully conversant in javascript.</p>

<p>Looking at what it costs and what it gives, coffee-script is extremely expensive. It adds a large amount of overhead, it significantly reduces the number of people that feel comfortable understanding your project and it provides very little benefit all in the form of syntactic sugar.</p>

<hr />

<p>After this analysis of why i don’t like to employ coffee-script myself it might be worth exploring why I believe module creators should not use it either.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you write your module in coffee-script you add the complexity of coffee-script to the complexity of your own module without providing the user with additional benefits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that is already the best case scenario where the user is willing to engage your module. The other option the user of your module has is to effectively treat it as closed-source, because coffee-script has to be treated as immutable if you are not willing to write coffee-script. While it you might be able to modify the compiled/generated javascript, your changes will never go upstream, because there it’s coffee-script. So for all intents and purposes you are writing closed-source software (or at least almost).</p>

<hr />

<p>So there simply isn’t a rationale to adding coffee-script to your stack if you are writing non-trivial code.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In fact coffee-script is detrimental to your code</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hypothesis being that living your eulogy is superior and living your resume is a failure. Maybe we are just doing eulogies wrong. Maybe eulogies should not be about “how human” the deceased was.</p>

<p>It may not be</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>His crowning achievement was when he made Sales Director.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but rather</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>he strived and dreamed of becoming Sales Director, and he had enough gumption to actually make it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>maybe it shouldn’t be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We especially remember him as a person who had a MBA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but maybe it should be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He had an awesome education and put it to good use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe we should rethink how we do eulogies. I for one am rather sick of going to funerals and hearing what a great human the deceased was, when he was a complete tosser and a waste of oxygen. Maybe we should hold eulogies about the impact the person had on their surroundings rather than nice sounding platitudes.</p>

<p>It’s very easy to claim it may be a better world if we all went after the platitudes, but it would be a desperately depressing world as well. I would rather celebrate someone for being an <em>inspiring asshat</em> than a depressing <em>good human being</em>.</p>

<p>Forcing people to register a separate account with disqus with an email and a password, is not streamlining. It’s stupidly adding a hurdle to commenting. If I want to comment, I want to do so with one of my online identities like twitter. I don’t then want sign up with your messed up system.</p>

<p>Boycot disqus for stupidity!</p>

<p>With the surveillance of the world by the NSA being played up and down the media, it is easy to forget why it is a problem to begin with. It’s easy to argue that the NSA actually should do what it’s doing, after all they are fighting terrorists and criminals, and these arguments are dangerously alluring.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonathanmcintosh/3744953433/" title="Surveillance by jonathan mcintosh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3632/3744953433_e3b523e24d_n.jpg" alt="Surveillance" /><br />
Surveillance by jonathan mcintosh, on Flickr</a></p>

<p>We want to feel safe, surveillance by the state needs its limits. It needs them not just for those that have nothing to hide, but also to those that do. While we general want to have our populace to obey the agreed upon laws and conventions, social evolution happens because people challenged the established borders and laws in our society.</p>

<p>This is not some abstract thought experiment, this is something that we were able to observe within living memory. Imagine for a minute the world of 1955. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Parks"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Rosaparks.jpg/168px-Rosaparks.jpg" alt="Rosa Parks" /><br />
Rosa Parks - Image Source: Wikipedia</a> If Rosa Parks had been constantly surveilled, the civil rights movement might not have ever gotten of the ground. What if the NSA, that had just been founded 3 years before, had ignored it’s mandate limit and listened in on every meeting of Martin Luther King.</p>

<p>While the breaking of laws in general is something societies frown upon, it’s the breaking and bending of established norms that is the universal cause of progress. If our surveillance becomes so tight as to basically eliminate all law breaking, we eliminate progress.</p>

<p>If that were all, then we could put it off for the future. After all even with the NSA programs that have become public and the ones that likely exists and have not become known yet we are quite a bit of from total surveillance yet. The problem though is that even before the system has become perfect, it throws its shadows.</p>

<p>It’s about self-censorship. If you have to fear that the government is listening to you and have to fear consequences from what you say, you will automatically restrict what you say. Whether the state actually assigns consequences or not is actually immaterial. The potential for consequences due to the existence of government surveillance is a sufficient motivator for self-censorship.</p>

<p>A prime example for this in another context can be found in the book publishing industry of modern day China. A recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/world/asia/authors-accept-censors-rules-to-sell-in-china.html">New York Times article</a> on the subject contains the following quote by the editor in chief of a prominent publishing house in Beijing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Self-censorship has become the most effective weapon”<br />
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/world/asia/authors-accept-censors-rules-to-sell-in-china.html">New York Times: Authors Accept Censors’ Rules to Sell in China</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stopping social progress is a problem for any imperfect society. We can all agree that the United States, while better than many/most, has not yet attained perfection. Until it has government surveillance is a problem.</p>

<p>I speak of the United States because it’s a country whose issues touch the entire world and anyone on the planet will be aware of the media coverage of the US surveillance programs as well as the countries history. The same principal applies to any society.</p>

<p>To believe that there is a country on the planet that is capable of observing its citizens that is currently refraining is akin to believing in the easter bunny. Of course GCHQ (Great Britain), the BND (Germany) and many others are doing the same thing. This is a globalised world and this is a global issue.</p>

<p>So it’s not just that the NSA is a danger to the USA, government surveillance is a danger to the western world.</p>
