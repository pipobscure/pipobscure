    <p>Not so with politics. How all of us vote, collectively, matters a great deal. But how any one of us votes does not. Imagine a college professor told her class of 210 million students, “Three months from now, we’ll have a final exam. You won’t get your own personal grade. Instead, I’ll average all of your grades together, and everyone will receive the same grade.” No one would bother to study, and the average grade would be an F.</p>

<p>That in a nutshell is how democracy works.</p>

Now, this is a story all about how My life got flip turned upside down And I’d like to take a minute Just sit right there I’ll tell you how I became The President and abolished welfare</p>

<p>In Queens New York I was born and raised A rich man’s playground is where I spent most of my days Chillin’ out maxin’ relaxin’ all cool And all shootin some black kids outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to no good Started making money in my neighborhood I bought out all of their businesses til they got scared Dad said ‘You’re going it alone with a billion I have spare’</p>

<p>I whistled for my limo and when it came near The license plate said “Pres” and it had a c**t in the mirror If anything I wondered what the driver was on But I thought nah, forget it, yo homes, Washington!</p>

<p>I pulled up to the white house about seven or eight And I yelled to the driver “Yo, homes fire you later!” I looked at my kingdom I was finally there To sit on my throne as The Pres with sh** hair</p>
