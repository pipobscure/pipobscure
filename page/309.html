<p>Interesting reminder that effective changes are not always obvious. Testing is a methodical way to verify what you are doing.</p>

<p>Dustin Kirkland wrote a very nice piece entitled <a href="http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2013/10/fingerprints-are-user-names-not.html">Fingerprints are Usernames, not Passwords</a>. He is pretty much correct about using biometrics as an authentication mechanism. It’s a bad idea in terms of security.</p>

<p>What annoys me about the whole biometrics conversation though is that it pretty much misses the point completely. What is happening in the discussion is that on the one hand you have the biometrics industry, pushing biometrics as a solution for all kinds of security problems, and on the other hand security experts, and other smart people like Dustin, dispute that biometrics are inherently insecure. The core problem though is that security is a matter of definition.</p>

<p>Let’s think about security in terms of the physical world. How do we secure our homes. We have locks, that can easily be picked; windows that shatter at the toss of a stone; doors that will not resist the boot of a determined intruder. And yet we are satisfied with the security provided by these measures.</p>

<p>Thinking now in terms of IT systems, especially phones; Fingerprints are obviously insufficient security for the proverbial nuclear launch-codes. But then so are dinky locks insufficient for Fort-Knox.</p>

<p>Are fingerprints sufficient for my smartphone though? Well that kind of depends on the information stored in there. For most of it, a fingerprint is enough. Just like a regular door and lock are sufficient for most parts of my house. But then there are small pieces of information, that may need to be on my phone secured by additional means, just like I have a safe at my house to better protect especially valuable items.</p>

<p>You see, it really is a matter of degrees. For the most part, securing a phone, or laptop with a fingerprint is ok; it’s a sufficient deterrent to the casual intruder.</p>

<p>And then there are pieces of data, that are a bit more sensitive. Those I’ll have to protect in addition to the regular access control. Passwords might be a good choice for a lot of that. However passwords aren’t all that great a solution either. They really are too weak for real security.</p>

<p>If the proverbial nuclear launch-codes were protected with a simple password system, I’d be really scared. Nope, they are protected by multi-factor systems. For really sensitive data, that is a must.</p>

<p>So security really is a matter of degrees; a matter of what needs to be secured and against what threats.</p>

<p>And that’s why I’m so annoyed at the simplistic conversation going on about biometrics in security. To really provide us with good security, we will need to think about security much more in detail.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zenlight/77206900/" title="Yosemite by AlexPears, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/9/77206900_ce91f17294.jpg" alt="Yosemite" /></a></p>

<p>The US Congress, in particular the Republican faction of the House, has decided that their bruised ego is more important than pretty much anything else. So they decided that shutting down the entire US federal government (with a very few exceptions) was a good idea.</p>

<p>One of the things that did shut down, was national parks. And that’s where my understanding really stops.</p>

<p><strong>Why</strong> shutdown a park. It has been around long before humans, it doesn’t really need running! Forcing people out and blocking the area off is just silly.</p>

<p>First off, blocking the park actually costs money. Simply sending federal employees home would have been much cheaper.</p>

<p>Second, what the heck are they “shutting down”?</p>

<ul>
  <li>the gift store? - who cares!</li>
  <li>the trees? - <strong>how? why?</strong></li>
  <li>the rocks? - <strong>how? why?</strong></li>
  <li>the rivers? - <strong>how? why?</strong></li>
  <li>the animals? - <strong>how? why?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t think any other country on the planet would even contemplate “shutting down a national park”. Maybe shuttering the ranger station and the gift shop for a couple of days, but this?</p>

<p>It all started out as a couple of House Republicans showing of that they aren’t the brightest people in the world. It ended up demonstrating, that maybe those representatives are still a lot smarter than the park service.</p>

<p>He is absolutely correct:</p>

<p><strong>The single easiest way to ensure that mistreatment of human beings is legal is to eliminate the laws that make it illegal.</strong></p>

<p>It’s logical, it’s honest, it’s contemptible.</p>

<p>when Carl von Clausewitz (1780-1831) said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>War is the continuation of politics by other means.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I always thought he was being callous about war. Being a Prussian general that assumption is reasonable.</p>

<p>Looking at politics today though I have realised that maybe he was simply saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Politics is just as stupid as war but you don’t get quite as bloody.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or maybe elections in Austria are just depressing.</p>

<p>It seems that there are still some like the LAUSD that have not realised yet, that you cannot lock down technology and still expect it to be useful.</p>

<p>The LA-Times reported that <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-lausd-ipad-hack-20130925,0,6974454.story">LAUSD halts home use of iPads for students</a>, which might just be the silliest thing to it could do. The one thing sillier is to truly believe that it could prevent this to begin with.</p>

<p>But aside from all that, there is a much deeper question that should be raised. That is not “<em>can</em> we prevent students from surfing the net”, but “<em>should</em> we prevent students from surfing the net”.</p>

<p>As has been previously discussed in <a href="http://pipobscure.tumblr.com/post/62261968235/what-inner-city-kids-know-about-social-media-and-why">what inner city kids know about social media</a> kids don’t really need to be protected from the internet by people that know less about it than they do. We (and the LAUSD) should be proud that students circumvented the stupid restrictions so quickly and commend them for it. They should also not restrict students use of the tools that they were given.</p>

<p>The LAUSD should be embarrassed by all of this. Not that their security measures where circumvented, but rather that they thought they were warranted and their reaction to the circumvention. Maybe the people at the LAUSD should be sent back to school; obviously they are not yet ready for the 21st century.</p>
