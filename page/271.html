<p>I’ve been preaching for years that time is the wrong unit of measurement for work. Yet until we find something better (and no the article does not make a valid suggestion) it will not be replaced.</p>

    <p>17% of cardiac surgeons are women, 17% of tenured professors are women. It just goes on and on. And isn’t that strange that that’s also the percentage of women in crowd scenes in movies? What if we’re actually training people to see that ratio as normal so that when you’re an adult, you don’t notice?</p>

<p>…We just heard a fascinating and disturbing study where they looked at the ratio of men and women in groups. And they found that if there’s 17% women, the men in the group think it’s 50-50. And if there’s 33% women, the men perceive that as there being more women in the room than men.</p>

<p>Seriously, go listen to this.</p>

<p>(via <a href="http://josette-arnauld.tumblr.com/">josette-arnauld</a>)</p>

<p>Interesting.</p>

<p>That means if the ratio is actually 50:50 it feels like 80:20 to men? Sounds about right.</p>

<p>How about <strong>lifeblr</strong>? It contains all of the above:</p>

<p>I want to keep fit and healthy, have sex, have kids love fun, cook food …</p>

<p>So if you see something you don’t expect, well good, that’s life! If you like it, well good, that’s life! If you don’t like it, then well tough, that’s life too.</p>

<p>How about not playing the label game, it’s kind of silly.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>If kids can’t socialize, who should parents blame? Simple: They should blame themselves. This is the argument advanced in It’s Complicated: The Social Lives of Networked Teens, by Microsoft researcher Danah Boyd. Boyd—full disclosure, a friend of mine—has spent a decade interviewing hundreds of teens about their online lives.</p>

<p>What she has found, over and over, is that teenagers would love to socialize face-to-face with their friends. But adult society won’t let them. “Teens aren’t addicted to social media. They’re addicted to each other,” Boyd says. “They’re not allowed to hang out the way you and I did, so they’ve moved it online.”</p>

<p>It’s true. As a teenager in the early ’80s I could roam pretty widely with my friends, as long as we were back by dark. But over the next three decades, the media began delivering a metronomic diet of horrifying but rare child-abduction stories, and parents shortened the leash on their kids. Politicians warned of incipient waves of youth wilding and superpredators (neither of which emerged). Municipalities crafted anti-loitering laws and curfews to keep young people from congregating alone. New neighborhoods had fewer public spaces. Crime rates plummeted, but moral panic soared. Meanwhile, increased competition to get into college meant well-off parents began heavily scheduling their kids’ after-school lives.</p>

<p>The result, Boyd discovered, is that today’s teens have neither the time nor the freedom to hang out. So their avid migration to social media is a rational response to a crazy situation. They’d rather socialize F2F, so long as it’s unstructured and away from grown-ups. “I don’t care where,” one told Boyd wistfully, “just not home.</p>
