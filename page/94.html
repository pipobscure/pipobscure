  <p>“oh hey,” she said, “it’s a really touristy area, but since you’re gonna be passing through anyway, you might as well stop by pier 29, see the dragons. also, there’s a—”</p>

  <p>“hold on,” i said. “i knew your city had mountains, but. dragons? uh, actual living dragons?”</p>

  <p>“dude, it’s not a big deal. they’re there all the time. of course they’re majestic and everything, but they’re loud and cranky and mostly they lie around eating garbage. now and then the city council will talk about trying to make them roost somewhere else, but—”</p>

  <p>“dragons,” i repeated. i knew it was making me sound like a rube, but it was a lot to take in. “you live in a city that has <em>dragons</em>.”</p>

  <p>“no, it’s cool, we used to go see them when i was a little kid. it’s worth doing. but that whole area is mostly dragon-themed gift shops, and the commercialization is kind of a bummer. also, sometimes a dragon will melt somebody’s car and it’s a whole problem.”</p>

  <p>“fairytale-style, giant scaly fire-breathing dragons.”</p>

  <p>“honestly, i forget other cities don’t have them?” she said. “there’s a few other sites on the west coast where they gather. portland calls them wyverns, but that’s a portland thing.”</p>

  <p>“chicago’s got, like, bunnies and songbirds,” i told her, “but otherwise it’s just your typical vermin. pigeons, rats, sphinxes—”</p>

  <p>“sphinxes? <em>what the hell.</em>”</p>

  <p>“oh, yeah, they nest in the el tunnels. sometimes a fucking sphinx will flap down out of nowhere, bring the whole train to a halt until the front car answers a riddle.”</p>

  <p>“that sounds exciting,” she said.</p>

  <p>“it’s the worst. your train winds up being twenty minutes late, and you just have to hang out hoping somebody up there read their mythology. there’s supposed to be a program where the conductors get trained in riddling, but i don’t know. rahm emmanuel keeps saying it’s not a budget priority.”</p>

  <p>“huh,” she said. “guess the grass is always greener and all that. but on some level, it’s nice to remember that even with all these big box stores, the country still has some variety left in it.”</p>

  <p>“yeah, did you know that in rhode island they call water fountains ‘bubblers’?” i said.</p>

  <p>“whoa, seriously?”</p>

  <p>“i read it somewhere. crazy, right?”</p>

  <p>“crazy.”</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“Imagine you’re at a party. A guy offers you a drink. You say no. He says ‘Come on, one drink!’ You say ‘no thanks.’ Later, he brings you a soda. ‘I know you said you didn’t want a drink, but I was getting one for myself and you looked thirsty.’ For you to refuse at this point makes you the asshole. He’s just being nice, right? Predators use the social contract and our own good hearts and fear of being rude against us. If you drink the drink, you’re teaching him that it just takes a little persistence on his part to overcome your ‘no.’ If you say ‘Really, I appreciate it, but no thanks’ and put the drink down and walk away from it, you’re the one who looks rude in that moment. But the fact is, you didn’t ask for the drink and you don’t want the drink and you don’t have to drink it just to make some guy feel validated.” —The Art of “No” (Jennifer P.)</p>

    <p>I’ve never seen this post with the original caption before. I thought I loved it simply from the photography but the depth of the meaning behind it…. Wow.</p>

  <p>Wow…..</p>

<p>Actually this is WRONG.</p>

<p>If you take the cup and then pour it over his head, then you are the one being rude. If you just refuse and put it down, you are just making clear that NO actually means NO and that you find the persistent attempt to force you to have a drink both rude and creepy.</p>
