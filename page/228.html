    <p>What if we got rid of our expectations? What if we said, “Food doesn’t need to taste like anything. Let’s see what this tastes like.”</p>

<p>I heard tell of a wine expert who wanted to develop his palate, and so he would taste all kinds of things. Even dirt. Put dirt in his mouth, and see what it tastes like. Most people would be grossed out about it, but what if you just wanted to find out?</p>

<p>Be curious. Explore the taste of foods. Let go of expectations and prejudgements. You might find out some interesting things. And by the way: this works with everything in life, not just food.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Ari LeVaux: How is it that, in your opinion, glyphosate causes gluten sensitivity?</strong></p>

  <p>Stephanie Seneff: What we argued in the paper is that glyphosate binds to the gluten. Gluten usually forms cross-mesh connections between different amino acids, and glyphosate would disrupt that because it would prevent the cross-mesh by binding to the gluten and causing the gluten to stay in the form that is known to be more allergenic. So we believe glyphosate causes the gluten to assume the form that is more allergenic.</p>

  <p><strong>**ALV:</strong> Your paper discusses the reason that glyphosate is being sprayed onto wheat. Could you explain this practice?**</p>

  <p>SS: Glyphosate is being sprayed on wheat right before the harvest. This has become a more and more popular practice among farmers. We found specific data in the UK showing a dramatic increase in the practice of spraying the wheat with glyphosate right before the harvest. This is three or four days before they harvest the seed. You can’t imagine that that glyphosate has disappeared in those three or four days. The intent is to kill the plant.</p>

<p>I just checked manually through some of my favorite blogs. These are blogs that I assumed would show up in my dashboard, because I explicitly follow them. However for some odd reason there are oodles of posts that simply did not show up in my dashboard.</p>

<p>What’s with that. I mean what do I have to do to actually get all the posts I subscribed to?</p>

<p><strong>HELP!!!</strong></p>
