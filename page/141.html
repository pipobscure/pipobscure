  <a href="/2013/12/30/dogwithsharperteeth-pipobscure.html">However we do know that on the 9th of November 1938 the Nazis destroyed one mourning hall and defaced another in the jewish section of the central cemetary. They also ransacked many of the graves, Babette Beer’s final resting place likely among them. If that were not enough, the final battles for Vienna in 1945 were fought between the Russion and German armies on the grounds of the cemetary. So while i was tempted to actually go and find her grave (it’s actually also a beautiful park to wander in), I think I’ll desist.</a>

  <a href="/2013/12/30/a-delicious-coconut-concoction-topped-with.html">Blend 2 eggs with a cup of Mascarpone and add a bit of stevia and vanilla extract. Mix in coconut shavings and pour into a cake pan. Bake at 150 centigrade for 25 minutes. Then cool down over night in the fridge. It is now solid and delicious and cutable like cake. Oh and it’s delicious as sin!</a>
