<p>… problem is, most recipes are designed for four people. It’s no problem to alter a recipe, once you have made it a few times, but until then.</p>

<p>Thing is, it’s not enough to simply divide the ingredients by 4. I mean what the heck is ¼ dash of salt? Also a lot of things like gratins go into the oven in a form. Yeah you can take a smaller form, but that also means less depth and less surface area. So for some things that can throw off your oven time by like 100%. For other things it doesn’t change timing, because it actually just needs time.</p>

<p>So often on the first try I cook too much. But since most of the time I cook for myself only, since my family is decidedly not goin keto, I have to eat it myself. Problem there is that I am actually a pretty good cook, which means the stuff i make usually tastes amazing (at least to me), so not eating it all is really hard.</p>

<p>Well any case, if you have any good low-carb (as in ultra low) recipes designed for one person, please write them up and submit them. I’m going to publish them and do a collection of them.</p>

<p>Thanks all!</p>

        <p>The average length of a hug between two people is 3 seconds. But researchers have discovered something fantastic. When a hug lasts 20 seconds, there is a therapeutic effect on the body and mind. The reason is that a sincere hug produces a hormone called “oxytocin”, also known as the love hormone. This substance has many benefits in our physical and mental health, helps us, among other things, to relax, to feel safe and calm our fears and anxiety. This wonderful calming is offered free of charge every time we have a person in our arms, who cradled a child, we cherish a dog or cat, we’re dancing with our partner, the closer we get to someone or just hold the shoulders of a friend.</p>
