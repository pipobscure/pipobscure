<p>Is there a call-center-script that says <strong><em>“If a customer wants to get information on how to give us money, pretend to be a complete nit-wit”</em></strong> ?</p>

<p>If not, I just spoke to the dumbest ever agent. I mean this woman was risking her life speaking to me, because to get the phone to her ear she had to take out the headphones telling her to breathe.</p>

<p>She honestly answered my question on how to purchase an upgraded calling plan with: <strong><em>“Sorry sir, I am not permitted to give out that information due to the data-protection act.”</em></strong></p>

<p>On one hand that make me really want to be their customer, because if they are so worried about data-protection, that they wont tell me how to give them more money, I feel my data is going to be really safe. On the other hand <strong><em>that’s just bloody stupid</em></strong>, which is not an attribute I value in a company that I want to provide me with a complex technological service such as mobile phone service.</p>

  <p>look it’s fine if ur not religious omg it’s 100% ok but once u start telling people that their prayers are worthless, that God isn’t listening, that He is imaginary, that Jesus didn’t exist, that their religious texts are garbage, etc. then you’re a piece of shit shut up</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s fine if you are religious. In fact it’s 100% Ok. But the moment you tell someone that they’ll go to hell or that your faith is the only true one or that laws should be made in accordance to what your imaginary friend supposedly wants, you become an inexcusable asshole.</p>

  <p>I’ve had something in my right eye since last night. I tried over and over to get it out to no avail. I cried, and it has not been flushed out. I have yet to flip my eyelid out (though, not for a lack of trying), and I’m sure whatever it is is stuck under there. I can feel it scratching when I blink.</p>

  <p>Anyway, if you read later that I’ve died from a botched home eyelid/eyeball removal, you’ll understand that it was my only option.</p>

<p>Dann you! Now you made my eye itch in a psychosomatic bout of sympathy.</p>
