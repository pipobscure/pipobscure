<p>I guess if you snap a photo, you remember you have forgotten when you see the picture. While if you don’t take a photo, there is nothing to remind you you have forgotten, so you think you remember more when in reality you just don’t remember what you forgot because you don’t have a photo.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/carbonnyc/2634700955/" title="Posture! by CarbonNYC, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3126/2634700955_b4f25dcd9e_z.jpg" alt="Posture!" /></a></p>

<p>Over the last few days I have done an experiment. The basic premise was that the way you hold your body directly impacts how people react to you. If that is true, then any change, conscious or not to your bearing should alter the reaction of the world at large towards you.</p>

<p>Generally people walk slightly bent forward with the shoulders hunched slightly forward as well. All in all we generally appear more like the bicyclist in the the red shirt than the obviously proud participant in the NYC gay pride parade.</p>

<p>What if, I were to change the way I walk. Quite consciously mimicking a soldier on the parade ground, or for that matter the specimen in the fore-front of the photo above. This should then result directly in an altered reaction of the world toward me.</p>

<p>Now I did this experiment, and I do have some interesting results. The difference is actually more pronounced than I’d have ever thought. An upright posture automatically leads to a perceivable increase in perceived confidence. So simply by walking upright, people believe you are more confident. In addition, the altered reaction of your surroundings actually increases your own confidence. So you basically start a virtuous circle.</p>

<hr />

<p>Besides that I actually felt the strain in my back muscles for the first two days. After that it became much easier and my general posture improved a bit. I think I’ll keep going.</p>

<p>He is absolutely right, but it goes beyond news sites. I’m involved in the running of a price comparison portal for insurance, finance and utilities. In order to use our site to compare offers, we do not collect any personally identifiable information, but of course we only serve our visitors via SSL/TLS. Anything but that would be ethically unacceptable to me. No one else needs to know that you decided you need car insurance for a new Ford Mustang or are thinking about buying life-insureance, especially not government.</p>

<p>So his call to news sites is laudable, but it really goes for any site at all. There is no reason a web-site in 2013 should serve anything unencrypted.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I generally try to stay strong about my style of eating b/c I truly believe in it, from my personal experience and from the scientific literature I’ve studied. I know that my body gets hurt by gluten (and tells me about it); I can feel grains messing with digestion - they always get lodged in stomach and make me feel so heavy; rice makes me feel bloated like I’m going to explode; sugar is unsatisfying - I get all the joy before eating it, but get little enjoyment during and just crave more afterwards. With time, I’m getting deeper understanding by listening to my body - I’m noticing there are quite a few fruits that also feel unsatisfactory (certain apples, persimmons, oranges) vs. potatoes I handle really well.</p>

  <p>But honestly it is tough to stay strong every day - it’s hard for me to find satisfying lunch options around campus, unless it’s a salad which is tough to eat in winter-time. I want something warm! that’s not a sandwich or pasta or chili with beans… My bf loves veggies but also loves ordering out and getting fried foods etc. So I am constantly surrounded by food I shouldn’t eat, even though both bf and friends fully support me in my choices (which I appreciate).</p>

  <p>So sometimes my strength is at a big low… and then finally a cooking show comes on (bf lovesss watching cooking/diners.driveins.dives/manv.food/phantom.gourmet shows) where they don’t use any flour… and it’s all meats and veggies… and then Matthew Mcconaughey took that slice of pork and went over to the grease leftover from baking, added half a stick of melted butter, and soaked his piece of pork in it! And then ate it all with his hands. And Guy joined him as well! They rounded out the meal with no sugar margaritas. It was seriously a foodgasm.</p>

  <p>So I google M. Mcconaughey and learn that he follows paleo… and from the looks of it - a high fat version. And I just felt so good. It felt so nice to see someone on TV eat the way that I do. Esp someone who looks so in shape ;)</p>

  <p>Do any of you guys live in a house where you’re the odd man out? Any tips for staying true?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know so exactly what you mean. I’m basically on a 0-carb diet, meaning that there are no intentional carbs i.e. as close to zero as you can get while eating natural foods.</p>

<p>So I started to cook separate meals for myself. Then my daughter started reacting stronger to gluten, so now she is gluten-free. And we started cooking extra for her as well.</p>

<p>Now, when I prepare a meal on weekends, I basically cook at least three combinations of different dishes so there is something for everyone. We turned cooking into a family past-time. We all cook together and it’s usually a motley array of foods.</p>

<p>My issue wasn’t actually staying true once the effects became evident: I lost a lot of weight, my digestion improved, and so on. Once that happened, it became a self-fulfilling prophesy, because all of a sudden it’s a clear choice: either continue to stay strong, or go back the way things used to be. I faltered once and then felt it for almost 1 ½ weeks that’s all I needed for motivation.</p>

  <p><strong>Maria Konnikova</strong> explains why hitting the snooze button actually makes the wake-up process more difficult: <a href="http://nyr.kr/1buGCgH">http://nyr.kr/1buGCgH</a></p>

  <blockquote>

<p>Fascinating. I may have to rethink my alarm clock. Maybe I’d be better of getting those “daylight bulbs” they use for green houses and putting a dimmer switch on a timer instead. This way I can have slowly increasing light in the two hours before I actually need to be awake. Basically simulating sunrise.</p>

<p>Actually waiting for sunrise just doesn’t work, at least not during winter.</p>

My secret santa at work obviously likes the fact that I actually cook lunch at the office because I got this fab “low-carb to go” cook book. It’s full of low carb recipes for one person, which is awesome for the office.</p>

<p>As a result I tried one of the recipes today:</p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 cup of leaf spinach</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>½ cup cheese</li>
  <li>megnut</li>
  <li>½ cup cottage cheese</li>
  <li>smoked salmon</li>
</ul>

<p>You mix the spinach, eggs, cheese and megnut and spread them on a sheet of baking paper. Put that in the oven and bake. Take out the “omlet” and put cottage cheese and salmon on it. Roll it up and let it cool for 20 minutes. Cut it into slices and gobble it up.</p>

<p>Absolutely delicious.</p>
