  <p>“Hey fellows, don’t you hate it when women exercise their right to say ‘no’ to you?” is what I got from the facebook status. I’m glad it ticked off someone enough to write the comment below it.</p>

<p>Actually fellows I do hate that. The you go and risk your heart and are turned down and given the impression, that it’s a general disinclination rather than you personally. Then shortly thereafter it is clearly demonstrated that it was in fact you personally. You would be a total ass not to be affected.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing: Yeah the woman just made use of her right to decline a relationship. Fine, noone faults her for it, even Peter. He said: “… don’t you hate it when that happens…” not “… I hate these bitches that do this to me…”</p>

<p>I can hate something emotionally negative happening to me or someone else and still think it’s ok that it’s happening. To still think there was nothing wrong with how people acted, not even Peter.</p>

<p>His feelings were hurt and he talked about it. He didn’t blame anyone else for it; he didn’t claim that it was unfair or wrong. All he said is state what he felt and for that he is getting put down.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Say goodbye to the letters C, X and Q<br />
Well we still have those, but the predicted “spelling by sound” and “shortening of words” has actually happened <em>LOL</em></li>
  <li>Flying bicycles mean empty cities<br />
Well we don’t have flying bicycles, but the real prediction was that there was ubiquitous personal transportation. And that has occurred. Everyone has a car, a lot of people have moved out of the cities and some cities like London or San Francisco are becoming so expensive that the are “reserved for business”</li>
  <li>Everything will be coated in plastic, and food comes in frozen bricks<br />
While the details of the cleanup process aren’t there (yet?), everthing is covered in plastic.</li>
  <li>3D television, complete with “smellevision”<br />
We do have 3D TVs and we found that we really don’t want <em>smellevision</em> because really acting is a sweaty business.</li>
  <li>Space travel for all<br />
Not quite yet “for all”, but we are getting there.</li>
  <li>Underground homes, with automated kitchens<br />
“Men will continue to withdraw from nature in order to create an environment that will suit them better” as if that isn’t spot on.</li>
  <li>Communal showers for hippie homes<br />
All I have to say is <em>fitness club</em>.</li>
  <li>Colonies on the moon, of course<br />
Well this one ain’t happening yet. Like no progress.</li>
</ol>

<p>I for one think that 7/8 isn’t a list of “False Predictions”</p>
