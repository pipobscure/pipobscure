      <p>What if Scotty is not actually Scottish, though? </p>

      <p>Like, what if his name just happens to be Montgomery Scott, so all of his friends started calling him “Scotty,” and then every time he was introduced to a new person, they would be like “Oh, are you Scottish? My uncle was Scottish!”</p>

      <p>And finally, he just gets sick of explaining the situation, so he starts replying with “aye, laddie!” But then it turns out that the person he said that to was Captain Kirk, and he doesn’t want to admit that he lied to his new commanding officer, so he has to keep speaking in a ridiculously over-the-top brogue and commenting constantly on how much he loves drinking Scotch, and by the time that he realises that Kirk would have found humour in the situation, he’s in too deep and can’t stop pretending, and it gradually just becomes his normal speech pattern.</p>

      <p>Then, years later, the <em>Enterprise</em> is being inspected by a Starfleet engineer who’s actually Scottish, and Scotty takes him on a walking tour of his warp engines and is all like “Auch! Here be me wee bairns!” and the other engineer is just like “what the fuck is wrong with you?”</p>

      <p>I take the fact that James Doohan is Canadian as evidence of this theory.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Scotty hacking into his Starfleet personnel file to alter his place of birth.</p>

    <p>Scotty soundproofing his quarters on the <em>Enterprise</em> so that no one can hear him teach himself to play the bagpipes from instructional videos.</p>

    <p>Scotty making a great show of taking a shuttle down to Aberdeen to “visit his family” every time the <em>Enterprise</em> is in Earth orbit and then, once on the ground, discreetly site-to-site transporting himself to Vancouver or whatever.</p>

    <p><em>None</em> of these things are out of character or beyond his technical ability.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Yeah, but also in character: Jim Kirk has known since Day 1 that Scotty is not, in fact, Scottish, but is just sitting there waiting to see how far Scotty is willing to go to keep the story going. It started out as an “enough rope” situation but now it’s one of Jim’s greatest ongoing sources of entertainment and he wouldn’t admit at gunpoint that he knows.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Across the country, librarians have stepped in to verify facts and authenticate web content in a bid to counter fake news reports. The move reflects the key role libraries play in the lives of new Americans, with more than half visiting the institutions at least once a week, <a href="http://mblclegislativeagenda.com/files/pdfs/customizable/esi.pdf">according to the Institute of Museum and Library Services</a>, a point made by the American Library Association (ALA) when it condemned the immigration ban.</p>

  <h2 id="our-nations-120000-public-academic-school-and-special-libraries-serve-all-community-members-including-people-of-colour-immigrants-people-with-disabilities-and-the-most-vulnerable-in-our-communities-offering-services-and-educational-resources-that-transform-communities-open-minds-and-promote-inclusion-and-diversity-it-said-in-a-statement-that-encouraged-its-57000-members-to-speak-out-against-the-administration">“Our nation’s 120,000 public, academic, school and special libraries serve all community members, including people of colour, immigrants, people with disabilities and the most vulnerable in our communities, offering services and educational resources that transform communities, open minds, and promote inclusion and diversity,” it said in a statement that encouraged its 57,000 members to speak out against the administration.</h2>

  <p>School librarians were first off the mark against the new president and his followers, countering so-called “fake news” though information tools that promote researcher-vetted content on websites and by hosting community discussions and talks about critical thinking. Reports that the new administration had limited the flow of information from some departments was also condemned as censorship by the ALA’s <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=ALA+Office+For+Intellectual+Freedom&amp;oq=ALA+Office+For+Intellectual+Freedom&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0j69i60.327j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Office for Intellectual Freedom</a>.</p>

  <p>In Nebraska, assistant library director Rebecca McCorkindale created a poster using the tagline “Libraries for Everyone” that has been used to support campaigns across the US. Hennepin County library in Minnesota, which serves large Somali and Spanish communities, offered one typical response: it joined the “<a href="http://www.slj.com/2017/02/industry-news/after-travel-ban-schools-and-libraries-reassure-students-and-families/#_">All are welcome here</a>” campaign in a bid to reassure locals. Bernie Farrell, youth programs and services coordinator, said:</p>

  <h2 id="we-want-them-to-feel-welcome-we-want-them-to-feel-safe-we-want-them-to-feel-that-if-they-ask-questions-about-any-topics-well-give-them-relevant-and-helpful-information-or-relevant-and-helpful-referrals">“We want them to feel welcome. We want them to feel safe. We want them to feel that if they ask questions about any topics, we’ll give them relevant and helpful information or relevant and helpful referrals.”</h2>

  <p>Librarians in Cambridge, Massachusetts followed others by declaring their libraries sanctuary spaces in which illegal immigrants can seek protection, advice and help without fear or judgment.</p>

  <p>In Oregon, a library in Multnomah County, has promoted children’s books about refugees and immigrants, while others libraries have sold badges with the All Are Welcome slogan. In Pennsylvania, a Yemeni-American, Muslim doll has been made available at checkouts. Massachusetts-based librarian Elizabeth McKinstry told PBS Newshour: </p>

  <h2 id="we-are-huge-resources-for-newcomers-to-this-country-whether-its-for-connection-to-this-country-legal-resources-testing-preparation-citizen-tests-services-like-story-times-or-homework-help-we-are-there-for-the-most-vulnerable-folks-in-our-communities-people-on-the-other-side-of-the-digital-or-language-divide">“We are huge resources for newcomers to this country, whether it’s for connection to this country, legal resources, testing preparation, citizen tests, services like story times or homework help. We are there for the most vulnerable folks in our communities, people on the other side of the digital or language divide.”</h2>

  <p>Co-ordinating much of the campaign has been Matthew Haugen, a librarian at Columbia University, who set up the <a href="https://twitter.com/librariesresist?lang=en">LibrariesResist</a> Twitter account. The account and accompanying hashtag highlights local campaigns, shares resources and explains how libraries can be used as sanctuary spaces. Among materials available, <a href="http://www.publicbooks.org/trump-syllabus-2-0/">according to the Public Books website</a>, are a Stop Trump reading list and a Trump syllabus – a course that “explores Donald Trump’s rise as a product of the American lineage of racism, sexism, nativism and imperialism”.</p>
