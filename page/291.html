<blockquote>
  <p>Robot octopi are slithering into existence. Quick, picture a robot. You’re probably thinking of a talking pile of tin cans, or maybe some hard-shelled Roomba-like object on wheels. But engineers are coming alive to the possibilities of robotics fashioned of flexible polymers, powered by pneumatics and electric currents, that move as delicately and flexibly as an octopus or a worm.</p>

<p>Takes all the realism out of shooting tin cans. How the hell is a guy supposed to get his dose of Terminator exercise now?</p>

  <p>Tumblr help please. Does my outfit match? Flowery dress and glittery flowery tights with my punk-ish boots (I’d love to stay “barefoot” with shoe type). And then red sweater.</p>

  <p>Do the styles go together or am I off base?</p>

  <p>Thank youuuu</p>

  <p>Happy and Safe Friday the 13th!</p>

<p>Take it from an old man. Clothes work in a miraculous way. Thing is if you truly like a combination, it will work. Because if you feel good about a look, you project that outward, and that is what makes you able to pull it of.</p>

<p>Think about how some men can’t wear suits, cause they just look out of place in them. That’s not because the suit doesn’t work, it’s because they don’t project “I look awesome in a suit” because they don’t feel that.</p>

<p>Same goes for all clothing. Think how Mick Jagger can pull of a pair of Jeans, a ripped T and a funky bandana, while most guys his age couldn’t. The reason is simply because they aren’t comfortable with themselves in those clothes.</p>

<p>So when you ask Tumblr if the outfit works, the answer is most certainly NO, not because it doesn’t work, but because you don’t feel sure about yourself in those clothes. Now if you asked yourself, while looking in a mirror: “Do I like that look?” and answer truthfully “YES” then that outfit will work.</p>

<p>What it’s worth, I think it goes over well, but then I’m just an old man.

Paradoxically, given the constraints remaining in their own country, the Castro brothers played a role, too.”</p>

<p>I’m hanging out in Budapest for the weekend. While in the hotel elevator, I overheard this American couple asking the same stupid question that every American that leaves her country for the first time asks:</p>

<p><em>Why do they number the floors differently?</em></p>

<p>After I resisted the urge to scream and explain the concept of cultural and linguistic differences to them, I decided to write a short post with the actual boring explanation:</p>

<p>In most European languages, the word for <em>floor</em> does not mean the same exact thing. Instead the French word <em>etage</em> or the German <em>Stock</em> actually mean something like <em>added level</em>. So of course the <em>first added level</em> is the not the <em>ground level</em> but the one above.</p>

<p>So simple and yet it has challenged travellers for ages.</p>

<p><strong>Please no!</strong></p>

<p>I love the fact that I can actually distinguish cover art now. It makes finding what I want to listen to. Just plain lists are way too dense and make it hard to use, even with my slight fingers.</p>
