<blockquote>
  <p>When I ask people if they’ve seen the show I’m about to recommend, a common response is, “You mean the British one?” Yes, the British one. Coupling, a sitcom from the early aughts, was created by Steven Moffat, also a co-creator of the current BBC series Sherlock and showrunner for Doctor…</p>

<p>I can vouch for this being a great show.</p>

    <h1 id="pro-tip-do-not-trust-google-maps">Pro Tip: Do Not Trust Google Maps</h1>

<p>About a year and a half ago I used GoogleMaps and got led to turn left the wrong way on a major thoroughfare. Well I didn’t blame Google, after all what did I expect.</p>

<p>What I did instead is report the problem. I marked it, described the precise issue and jumped through all their hoops. In the end I was notified that my input was now part of Google Maps. YIPPEEH!!!</p>

<p>Today I asked Google Maps again for directions. And guess what, it made the same goddamn mistake again. Not similar, THE FUCKING SAME MISTAKE that leads you down the wrong side of a highway. The same fucking mistake, that I fucking helped them fix more than a year ago.</p>

<p>Now in my book, when you make a potentially dangerous error, that’s a mistake; if you are told and don’t fix it, it’s negligence; if you are told, and claim to have fixed it and don’t, then that’s gross negligence.</p>

<p>And guess what. Gross negligence makes you liable even if you disclaim liability. Watch out Google, this is the way companies get sued into oblivion and I’d hate that.</p>

              <p>Some zoos only take old animals to where they are given an easy life. Their maintenance is funded by people coming into the zoo.</p>

            <p>“Zoos are fucking stupid” wow such science you sold me</p>

            <p>They weren’t captured for this purpose, they probably weren’t captured at all, it’s called rescuing. </p>

            <p>This is cool.</p>

            <p>This is not abuse, it’s actually exercise if you think about it.</p>

            <p>Zoos are not prisons. Zoos allow us to rescue animals, research them, and protect them from hunters and the dangers that we, as humans, impose on them.</p>

            <p>I’m so done with all the shit about zoos on my fucking dash. </p>

            <p>Zoos literally save animals every day so why don’t you do your freaking research.</p>

          <p>This comment is perfect^</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Animals come to zoos as a result of </p>

        <ul>
          <li>being born captive</li>
          <li>getting injured in the wild and rescued to live a healthy life in captivity</li>
          <li>being rescued from black market dealers, private collectors, or the like who decide that they can no longer care for the animals or who had been illegally keeping the animals</li>
          <li>being in a breeding program to increase their numbers because the animal is endangered in the wild</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you knew anything about tigers at all, you’d know that they are endangered in the wild due to poaching and hunting. It is of utmost importance that their numbers increase, or they will go extinct within the next fifty years. I don’t know what zoo this is so I don’t know their reputation, but the tigers look healthy, and this tug-of-war is good for them because some animals get stressed in zoos when they are bored. This isn’t solely to entertain zoo guests, it is to give the tigers something fun to do.</p>

        <p>Zoos do not snatch animals from the wild without a good reason. If you want to protest animal captivity, go to SeaWorld and protest the orcas being kept there, they are far too large to belong in such cramped spaces and they are solely kept for entertainment.</p>

        <p>Thank you and good day.</p>

      <p>ALSO ITS NOT LIKE THEY’RE FORCING THE TIGERS TO GRAB THE ROPE, THE TIGER WANTS TO PLAY</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Tigers play just like domestic cats play with each other, this is for the educational benefit of the visitors and the enrichment benefit of the tigers. Also word to the comment above. Tigers are endangered to the point that they cannot repopulate themselves in the wild, they need the help of captive institutions like zoos, where they live carefree lives free of stress and can breed and birth without fear that other predators and mating competitors will come along and eat their cubs.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, these tigers are NOT thin. In fact, one of the ones in the large group looks borderline obese. People who know nothing about animals need to stop talking about animals.</p>

  <p>Boosting the shit out of this because I’m so damn tired of whiney morons (who probably never get outside) bitching about animal’s rights when they really have no fucking clue.</p>

  <p>DO YOUR GODDAMN HOMEWORK.</p>

<p>And stop f’ing skinny shaming the tigers!</p>
