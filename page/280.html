<p>This being New Years Eve, I had a couple of glasses of champagne. And as you are likely to learn, that’s a dangerous thing, because it makes me ponderous.</p>

<p>What I am ponderous about right now, is some of the tumblrs I am following and their doubtful outlook on life. There are people doubting their self worth, people complaining about a shit year, and more negativity.</p>

<p>And reality is, they are not perfect, and neither was the last year. But then I try to put things into perspective. We all have a roof over our heads, sufficient food and regular access to the internet. We live in more or less civilised and democratic countries that vouch-safe our personal safety. So actually for us, the year 2013 was comparatively awesome.</p>

<p>But even if you don’t like the global comparison thing, there is something you need to realise. You exist, and you provide me with pleasure through your posts. And it is highly likely, that it’s not just me whose life you are improving. So even if the entire rest of your life were an abject failure, you would still be a valuable asset to this world.</p>

<p>So rather than feel sorry for yourself, celebrate the passing of 2013 and get excited about the coming year. And do so in the knowledge that each and everyone of you is being appreciated. So thank you all for a fun year. Stay positive. No one I follow has a real reason to feel down about themselves.</p>

  <p>In social issues class today our professor held up a black book and was like “this book is red” and we were all “no” and he said “yes it is” and we were just all “that’s not right” and he turned it around and the back cover was red and he said “Don’t tell somebody they’re wrong until you’ve seen things from their point of view” </p>

<p>That’s a pretty good story and a point worth remembering.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More specifically, I trust in the scientific method.  Science isn’t the surface scratchings or headlines you see published in newspapers. Many scientific studies are published without appropriate disclaimers in the media, and are presented as facts when in truth the study may have said that further study is needed. Thus I’m always skeptical of science news headlines.</p>
