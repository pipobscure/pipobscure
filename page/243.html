    <p>One billion people are malnourished while one-third of the world’s arable land is devoted to the production of feed crops for livestock.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pigbusiness.co.uk/issues/20-facts/">20 True Costs of Factory Pig Farming</a></p>

<p>(and lets not forget that the amount we grow is sufficient to feed those one billion people <em>and then some</em>) </p>

<p>(via <a href="http://delices-detre-vegetalien.tumblr.com/">delices-detre-vegetalien</a>)</p>

<p>This creates the appearance that if we were to stop farming animals, then those <em>one billon people</em> would have food and not be malnourished. That is pure fantasy; Human beings are not fair; if we stopped animal farming, the western world will come up with other uses for arable land and the crops grown there; anything to prevent feeding the malnourished; they’d come up with inventions like fuelling vehicles with crops before even giving the possibility of feeding the world a single thought.</p>

<p>I for one will stick with eating meat.</p>

    <p>*Question: *Could you maybe explain some more about the whole ‘fake it till you make it’ thing? You’re my inspiration btw :3</p>

<p>*Answer: *Fake it until you make it is one of my favourite philosophies. It’s a Placebo effect of sorts. People underestimate the power of their brains, and how much it controls, but it can also constrict you. Mind over matter and all that.</p>

<p>There are multiple studies showing placebos. For example if you give someone a sugar tablet (with no medicine) and show them loads of fake research saying how good the tablet is and how it can cure illnesses, but you have to get them to really believe it. Once they believe the tablet is working they usually get better even though there was no medicine present it was just them subconsciously willing themselves to get better.</p>

<p>I remember when I was younger. We live near the beach so we used to spend practically all summer there. There was this row of big boulders that lined the car park, and I always tried to jump from one rock to the other pretending I was a superhero. But there was this one rock that was spaced a little wider. No matter how much I tried I could never make the jump. It wasn’t that the distance was unattainable (the gap was probably just about a foot wider) it was that I was afraid that if I missed it I would hurt myself. One time I was chasing my cousin down the rocks, I had nearly caught up to her, she was one rock ahead. So I just jumped and caught her. Without even realising I had made the jump that I had been afraid to make for years. And ever since then I was always able to make the jump, because I knew I could. </p>

<p><strong>The moral of that story is that confidence does an awful lot for a person. Sometime just thinking you can do something is enough.</strong></p>

<p>Fear holds people back, they’re afraid of failure, or that they can’t handle a situation or whatever. But what is there really to fear? So what you failed, now you get to try again.</p>

<p><strong>The only real loser is the one who was so afraid of losing that they never even tried. They had already lost before they even had a chance to win.</strong></p>

<p>So that’s where fake it until you make it comes in. You want to be more confident? more successful? more outgoing? Fake it. Act like you already are all those things. It’ll be weird and awkward at first, believe me I know. But fuck it. Just DO IT! Eventually it’ll become second nature, and you won’t be faking it anymore. You’ll know what you’re capable of and in essence that’s the make it part. Hope I helped.</p>

    <p>Because paper towels are the most effective weapon against zombies.</p>

  <p>How bad will this guy feel when he realizes he just threw something at a disabled person</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question I have is why anyone would think that the guy <em>should</em> feel bad about throwing paper-towels at the guy. If you come at me and invade my personal space, rather than approach me and alert me to the fact that you wish to interact, you are lucky if I only throw paper towels at you.</p>

<p>It makes no difference if you are disabled or not. You approach others with courtesy and don’t sneak up on them. If you do, you are an asshat. And just because you are disabled doesn’t change that.</p>

<p>This guy is taking a huge risk, because it might not have been paper towels. Other people have the instinct to kick out, resulting in a boot in the face. And you cannot nor should you blame the guy throwing the towels for this.</p>

<p>Which brings me back to the original question: <em>why should the guy feel bad for throwing paper towels? Or better why would we as a society be inclined to permit gross misconduct by someone and blame their victim.</em> I don’t blame a victim of rape for fighting back. Though this is obviously not in the same league as rape, the principle is the same. We are asking a person who has their personal space violated to excuse the attacker and blame themselves for reacting; in one case because the attacker is a man and the attackee a woman, in another case because the attacker is disabled and the attackee is not?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using a mathematical model based on the spread of disease developed from a presentation called, “The Social Network Disease: Epidemiology and The Demise of Facebook,” authors John Cannarella and Joshua A. Spechler suggest that if MySpace is an example of what happens to social networks, Facebook is already on the decline. “In this paper we have applied a modified epidemiological model to describe the adoption and abandonment dynamics of user activity of online social networks. Using publicly available Google data for search query Myspace as a case study, we showed that the traditional SIR model for modeling disease dynamics provides a poor description of the data. Having validated the irSIR model of OSN dynamics on Google data for search query Myspace, we then applied the model to the Google data for search query Facebook.</p>

<p>…with my wife. It’s awesome how you feel afterwards. A day of steaming, saunas, infrared cabins, sole tunnels and whirl pools combined with ample opportunities for just reading or sleeping makes for a wonderfully relaxed feeling.</p>

<p>I highly recommend it!</p>

<p>It really doesn’t matter. It’s going to be way too cold outside for most Jewish mothers to let their kids attend to the game.</p>

<p>I don’t know, but most of the Jewish mothers are much less strict than their germanic equivalents.</p>
