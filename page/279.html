  <p>For real, though. You don’t have to adopt a vegetarian diet if you don’t want to, but don’t be an idiot and claim that you need meat or even dairy for protein because you don’t. Please. I beg of you.</p>

  <p>Damn that’s a lot. Now where the list of people who don’t test on animals?</p>

    <h1 id="dear-stupid">Dear Stupid</h1>

<p>If you decide to block the only thoroughfare at a train station and a kid falls over your luggage it’s a pretty dumb move to get in the kids face, especially if just behind the kid is it’s father that’s about double your size.</p>

<p>When you the get told to chill by your girl friend as well as the father of said kid, it’s never smart to throw a punch at said father.</p>

<p>If said father then decides not to engage in fisticuffs, but rather simply knees you in the balls and leaves it’s pretty silly to swear at your (ex?)girlfriend when she is leaving you there.</p>

<p>Here us some free advice:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Don’t be an inconsiderate asshat</li>
  <li>Don’t have a go at kids</li>
  <li>Don’t pick a fight you are going to loose</li>
  <li>Don’t swear at your girl</li>
</ol>

<p>These are just some basics, once you grasp those, there is a whole advanced class in being a man as well.</p>

<p>(P.S.: No I was not the dad in question, though I did empathize with him)</p>

  <p>Technology is great, but it kills certain things of nostalgia. Like mix tapes. Mix tapes were awesome. Make’em for your boyfriend, make’em for your best friends. You could record stuff from the radio or from another cassette tape if you were lucky enough to have a two-deck…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some things are just plain wrong. But maybe by just transporting the mix tape into the digital era, we can bring along the law. Mix tapes were perfectly legal, maybe this is a way to show stodgy a**holes that sharing digital music is exactly the same thing.</p>

    <p>If every trace of any single religion were wiped out and nothing were passed on, it would never be created exactly that way again. There might be some other nonsense in its place, but not that exact nonsense. If all of science were wiped out, it would still be true and someone would find a way to figure it all out again.</p>
