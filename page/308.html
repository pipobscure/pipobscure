    <p>Nearly a hundred years ago it was realized that statutes were necessary to address two groups of people who could not be counted on to have self control. In 1914 Congress passed the Harrison Narcotics Act which ended addicts’ unrestricted access to drugs, and in 1917 the Second Liberty Bond Act which ended Congress’s unrestricted access to borrowing money. A century later, some things don’t seem to have changed tremendously.</p>

<p>After I read <a href="https://twitter.com/maxogden/status/389081519009972224">@maxogden’s tweet</a> I was debating whether I really wanted to respond. Especially because this <a href="http://www.robot-hugs.com/but-men/">cartoon about these conversations</a> (thanks @izs for tweet) does have some truth to it.</p>

<p>However, I feel that there is a point that is being missed. We are all human beings first. If we create an environment where another human being feels unwelcome or uncomfortable, or worse threatened, that is a problem. For this to be a problem it does not matter one bit whether that person be female, male, cis-, trans- or whichever label you want to apply. It matters solely that a potential member of our community does not feel welcome.</p>

<p>One consequence of having created such an environment is the sprouting of sub-groups reserved for the sub-members that carry some sub-label or other. And that in turn is the official certificate of community failure.</p>

<p>So while having a girls night out with your node friends might be a valuable experience for a female noder (just as a stereotypical example), it should definitely not become a thing simply because it means that the node community has failed so badly that it has to be separated along more or less arbitrary gender lines.</p>

<p>To me that’s not not about discrimination against men or any such non-sense. It’s about failing to provide a community where people are respected for who they are and what they bring to the table. So rather than advocating Non-Binary-Node groups we should be working diligently on making our community one that does not need those sub-groups.</p>

<p>So if Max Ogden’s female friend is learning ruby rather than node because ruby has all these “women in ruby” groups, we should make the the effort of telling people, that they should learn node, because we have all those “humans in node” groups. Because that is truly being better rather than “no worse than usual”.</p>

  <p>Reviews of the new hit movie “Gravity” note that it’s an unusually fine science fiction film. What they don’t mention is that the main character represents an increasingly common theme in American religion: The spiritual “none of the above.”</p>

<p><em>TL;DR</em> - screwy methods produce good headlines</p>

<p>This article refers a lot to statistics and percentages. There are a few things to keep in mind though.</p>

<ol>
  <li>“I don’t trust any statistics that I did not fudge myself” is a truism</li>
  <li>The results of statistics depend heavily on how the questions are asked.</li>
</ol>

<p>The current default, especially in the US, is religiosity on an almost fanatical level. The “nones” are considered the exception. To be religious is considered the norm.</p>

<p>From such a starting point, it is very, VERY hard to actually come up with questions that do not influence the results towards religiosity. You can massage data into anyone believing anything if you just ask often enough in different ways.</p>

<p>Combine that with an article author that writes mainly for regligionnews.com and you have a predictably skewed outcome. This is not due to maliciousness, bias or ineptitude of the author or the statisticians! It is rather because the methods and tools employed are skewed by the presumption of what social norms are.</p>

<p><em>P.S.: I haven’t seen it yet and this article has not managed to turn me off it yet. It’s on my to-view-list.</em></p>

  <div class="content">
    <h1 id="sqrlcoolideanotquitethereyet">sqrl://cool.idea/not/quite/there/yet</h1>

<p>Today I looked at a very cool idea, by a very cool guy. <a href="https://twitter.com/sggrc">Steve Gibson</a> came up with <a href="https://www.grc.com/sqrl/sqrl.htm">a way to securely authenticate</a> over the web.</p>

<p>He describes his idea quite eloquently and invites everyone to have a discussion about it; to prod and poke at it; to test it for soundness. While I find the idea quite brilliant, I do have a couple of issues, that make it a no go for me in terms of becoming the future standard for web-authentication:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>URL-Specificity:</em> requiring the thing to use https:// or http:// or whatever is not a good idea. Who knows what protocol we will all be using a couple of years from now. SQRL should be possible over <a href="https://www.grc.com/x/news.exe?cmd=article&amp;group=grc.sqrl&amp;item=193">carrier pigeon</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Algorithm-Specificity:</em> requiring the thing to use <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/index.html">ed25519</a> is silly. It’s not ubiquitous enough, to make it easy for websites to implement, nor can we be sure that it will remain strong long enough. The algorithm needs to be negotiable for this to become standard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>QR-Codes:</em> are already an outdated technology. It might be ok as one way to represent the URL to be encrypted right now, but it will be obsolete before it has even gained adoption.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This is sad, because the fundamental idea is very good:</p>

<ol>
  <li>have a site present a nonce and a URL where to send authentication</li>
  <li>derive from that and a master-key a site unique private/public key-pair</li>
  <li>sign the nonce and the URL and send the result with the public key to the endpoint specified</li>
  <li>the public key is the unique identifier of the user</li>
</ol>

<p>All of that is sound. Even the suggested user experience is good, especially when combined with a browser plugin as suggested in <a href="http://twit.tv/show/security-now/424">Security Now: 424</a>. What is definitely not sound is the description of the protocol.</p>

<p>I have to note though that it’s early days yet. Not just is the current state not a full suggestion of a protocol, it’s not even a fully fleshed out idea yet, which you can see by the plethora of missing/to-be-done pages on <a href="https://www.grc.com">grc.com</a>.</p>

<p>So for now, it’s <strong>kudos to @sggrc</strong>, let’s work on getting this thing specified and fleshed out. It’s important to make sure this get’s done well, after all we don’t want to create an incompatibility nightmare here.</p>
