Not only is it morally wrong to let people live desperately on the streets, but it doesn’t make much economical sense either.</p>

    <p>A new study has found that it’s <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2014/03/23/4787934/study-concludes-charlotte-homeless.html#.UzL-lPldUiM">significantly cheaper</a> to house the homeless than leave them on the streets.</p>

    <p>University of North Carolina Charlotte researchers <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/25/housing-first-homeless-charlotte_n_5022628.html">released a study</a> on Monday that tracked chronically homeless adults housed in the Moore Place facility run by Charlotte’s Urban Ministry Center (UMC) in partnership with local government. Housing these people led to dramatic cost savings that more than paid for the cost of putting them in decent housing, including $1.8 million in health care savings from 447 fewer ER visits (78% reduction) and 372 fewer hospital days (79% reduction). Tenants also spent 84 fewer days in jail, with a 72% drop in arrests.</p>

    <p>Moore Place cost $6 million in land and construction costs, and tenants are required to contribute 30% of their income (mainly benefits) towards rent. The remainder of the $14,000 per tenant annually is covered by donations and local and federal funding. <strong>According to the <a href="http://www.nchousing.org/annual-conference/past-conferences/2013-conference/2013-workshops/presentations/301b/caroline-chambre.pdf">UNCC study</a>, that $14,000 pales in comparison to the costs a chronically homeless person racks up every year to society — a stunning $39,458 in combined medical, judicial and other costs.</strong></p>

    <p>What’s more, Moore Place is enabling the formerly homeless to find their own sources of income. Without housing, just 50% were able to generate any income. One year after move-in, they’re up to 82%. And after an average length of 7 years of homelessness, 94% of the original tenants retained their housing after 18 months, with a 99% rent collection rate.</p>

    <p><strong>The general population is biased:</strong> The original proposal for Moore Place was “controversial, if not ridiculed,” according to the <em><a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2014/03/23/4787934/study-concludes-charlotte-homeless.html#.UzL-lPldUiM">Charlotte Observer</a>.</em> Locals mocked the idea that giving the homeless subsidized housing would do any good. A <a href="http://www.amstat.org/sections/srms/proceedings/y2011/Files/400188.pdf">2011 report</a> commissioned by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority found that people have condescending attitudes towards the homeless, with <strong>the public perceiving higher levels of substance abuse problems (91%) and mental health issues (85%) than reported by the homeless themselves (41% and 24% respectively)</strong>. It concluded that if “<em>personal failings as the main cause of homelessness, it is unlikely that they will vote for increased public assistance or volunteer to help the homeless themselves.</em>”</p>

    <p>But “<strong><em>you can’t argue with the statistics,</em></strong>“ <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2014/03/23/4787934/study-concludes-charlotte-homeless.html#.UzL-lPldUiM">said</a> UMC housing director Caroline Chambre. “<em>This approach was controversial at one time because of the stereotype of who the homeless are, and we had to change that stereotype.</em>”</p>

    <p>In 2012, total welfare spending for the poor was <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/03/10-poverty-myths-busted">just 0.47% of the federal budget</a>. It turns out that maybe if we spent a little more to help the chronically destitute solve their problems, we could save a lot of money.</p>

  <p>This has been known for a long time but right-wingers will fight the idea of free housing to the death under the notion that it’s something “socialists” or “communists” would do and/or because Ayn Rand would say it’s a bad thing.</p>

  <p>The one silver lining is that a lot of the people who feel that way are old. Can we start a countdown page to when the last baby boomer is finally dead?
