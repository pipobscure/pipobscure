      <p>Undoubtedly in a few years, people are going to get so fucking sick of everyone trying to turn every case of brutality into a race/gender issue, that it will mean nothing and no one will ever give a shit ever again. Even when it’s a legitimate case of racism or sexism.</p>

    <p>It’s like we have this story you tell children in Poland (I wonder if other countries have similar ones. Followers?). It’s about a chicken who kept alerting other farm animals that a fox is trying to eat it. The animals rushed to the rescue just to be laughed at by the chicken who fooled them. And when one day a fox was really trying to get him and he screamed for help, no one came and the chicken got eaten.<br />
Brutal, yet it taught me that not everything is worth making a lot of fuss. Because one day I may really need help and no one will come. The same here when people pull the race or sexism card on almost everything.</p>

  <p>We have a similar story about a boy who shouted there was a wolf when there wasn’t and when there was, no one believed him and he got eaten.<br />

<p>Except right now the wolves are regularly devouring sheep and the foxes are feating on chickens. So I hope that before we get sick of it the farmers will take care of the wolf and fox problem.</p>
