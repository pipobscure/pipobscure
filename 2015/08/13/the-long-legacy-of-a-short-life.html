  <p>The Rosses were expecting twins but learned that one of the two, Thomas, wouldn’t live much past birth. They decided to donate Thomas’s body to science. And then, they decided to investigate just what it was they had given and how it had helped others. <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/grays-donation/">Great piece by Radiolab</a>.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The next day, Gray met James Zieske, the institute’s senior scientist, who told her “infant eyes are worth their weight in gold,” because, being so young, they have great regenerative properties. Thomas’ corneas were used in a study that could one day help cure corneal blindness.</p>

    <p>Thirteen more studies had cited that study. Gray felt a new emotion: pride.</p>
