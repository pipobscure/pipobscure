I love my bike!</p>

<p>Because the idle tick rate is set low, it want’s you to be a bit on the throttle when it’s cold. I was a bit too low, so it died. When trying to restart on the other hand I was a bit heavy handed so I flooded the carburettor. Now on most modern bikes this would have meant calling the RAC to come and rescue me.</p>

<p>Not with this baby! I simply got out the toolkit (comes with the bike) and unscrewed the carburettor, dumped out the excess petrol and screwed it back on. And off I was.</p>
