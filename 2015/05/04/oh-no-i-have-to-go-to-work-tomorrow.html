        <p>… is something I hear over and over again. And truth be told I don’t get it. If that’s your attitude to work, how do you expect anything good to ever come of it?</p>

<p>Let me tell you something, the single thing, that all successful people have in common: they all like what they are doing.</p>

<p>Now I get that “being successful” may not be the best measurement, after all it leaves out a whole lot of stuff.</p>

<p>So let’s look at it from a totally different angle. The socialist ideal held that you should spend 8 hours of every day with work, 8 with leisure and 8 with sleep. If you take away the sleep time, where you are more or less unconscious then that leaves you with spending HALF your waking hours working.</p>

<p>And that’s under ideal circumstances! In modern reality it’s probably even more. So if you are spending more than half your waking hours at something you dislike, then that’s a problem.</p>

<p>Of course I realise that there are external pressures that force us all to maybe do things we don’t like. But still if this is a persistent theme, it’s a problem. If you ever want a chance to actually like your life, if ever you want a chance to actually be happy, you better find a way to enjoy working by whatever means.</p>

<p>One thing is for certain: “oh no I have to go to work tomorrow” is a recipe for failing at happiness whatever else you do.</p>
