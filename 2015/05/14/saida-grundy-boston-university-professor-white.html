    <p>So apparently, Prof. Saida Grundy telling the truth is a problem.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.change.org/">Here</a> is the petition to stand in solidarity with Prof. Grundy. Support her!</p>

  <p>Substitute black for white and tell me what you think.</p>

<p>You are so totally right…</p>

<p>except: “Every year during MLK week I try not to spend a dime at a black owned business. No Problem!” would have to be the statement. Well I guess that shows the problem.</p>

<p>except: It’s pretending there weren’t just a couple of hundred years of slavery and discrimination culminating in an epidemic of killings by police that should make anyone sick to their heart.</p>

<p>except: Racism requires not just classification based on skin-colour, but discrimination. Which in turn requires the capability and use of disproportionate power toward oppressive ends. So right now, there is no such thing as “black racism”.</p>

<p>except: Oh fuck it, “black racism”, “meninism”, and the like don’t really add anything to the conversation. It’s a nice sounding excuse, but really, so long as we as a society have not attained anywhere near equal rights and opportunities for everyone, your “reverse reacism” comments are an insult to every thinking human who wants a better world.</p>
