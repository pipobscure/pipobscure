          <p>Alright let me help out then:</p>

          <p>1) Most of the cast is female. In fact only two main characters are male.</p>

          <p>2) Both male characters take typically non-masculine hobbies. Emerson Cod knits almost non-stop and makes pop-up books. Ned is literally called “The Pie-Maker” because he bakes homestyle pies from his mother’s method. Both are shown to be very nurturing and even maternal characters. Conversely, the women? A pair of professional travelling show performers that have gritty sexual scandals the way men usually get (see the entire “Chuck’s father” storylines), a beekeeper who is the single most positive and optimistic character imaginable, and a former professional jockey- Three of four pro athletes.</p>

          <p>3) You could very easily make the claim Ned is asexual.</p>

          <p>4) Yes, the storyline is about romance. But it’s also about the positive side of a love story, and their only drama lies in overcoming their inability to actually share contact.</p>

          <p>5) A very good friend of mine recommended this show to me as “Disney for adults.” I told her it was already on my list to watch because “It’s by Bryan Fuller, from Wonderfalls and Dead Like Me.” Bryan Fuller is now most known for “Hannibal.” The same camera methods and bright colours and lighting techniques Hannibal is known for? Perfected in this show, just using a different tone- The same colour methods in reverse, upping the vivid greens and yellows instead of reds and blues, which sells emotion both ways.</p>

          <p>7) Probably one of the best examples of a modern day fairy tale possible.</p>

          <p>8) Narrated by Jim Dale- The narrator for the HP audio books.</p>

  <p>Okay so thanks to this post I finally decided to have a go at watching Pushing Daisies. I have made it as far as the title screen of the first episode and I’m already in love, and ready to support the “Ned is asexual” claim. Thank you, pushing daisies bloggers :3</p>
