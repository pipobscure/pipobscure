Today is “Holocaust Remembrance Day” a day in the year dedicated to remembering the evil humanity is capable of.</p>

<p>Between 1933 and 1945 Nazi Germany managed to murder more than 6 million people whose only crime was to be Jewish or Roma or gay or otherwise “undesirable”.</p>

<p>Lest we believe that this is just history let’s examine our world today and see if there be anti-semitism, racism and hatred in it. We owe it to those who perished to do so in their name and remember!</p>
