      <p><strong><em>Ally’s snooping upset White House because information was used to lobby Congress to try to sink a deal</em></strong></p>

      <p>Soon after the U.S. and other major powers entered negotiations last year to curtail Iran’s nuclear program, senior White House officials learned Israel was spying on the closed-door…</p>

    <p>So can we sanction and embargo them yet? Instant economy stimulation.  </p>

  <p>I’m surprised how many Conservatives don’t realize that Saddam Didn’t have weapons that Israel does have and Saddam killed and imprisoned far FEWER people than Israel does currently.  Yet we had to remove Saddam before he Destabilized the Middle East/World, and we never seemed to have to worry about him spying on US.</p>

<p>I am continually surprised by the level of dishonesty.</p>

<p>The U.S. spies on everyone, friend or foe; why is that OK and if someone else does it that’s a problem?</p>

<p>The U.S. has more people imprisoned per capita than any other industrialised country, including Israel; but the number of Israel’s prisoners is a problem?</p>

<p>The U.S. has more weapons per capita than any other country (with the possible exception of North Korea) and is unchallenged top dog in military spending; but Israel having weapons is an issue?</p>

<p>Israel is a mature, democratic, modern country; the only one in the region. And that’s compared to Saddam who felt no qualms about using chemical weapons on Kurds in his own country?</p>

<p>Seriously? Get your head out of your rear!</p>

<p>—-</p>

<p>Just accept that gathering intelligence on foreign activities that are likely to affect your country is a normal part of life. If you don’t want Germany bitching about listening in on Merkel’s phone, an activity unlikely to yield anything useful, then stop complaining about Israel listening to talks with its chief external threat about nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>If you want to keep fighting a “war on terror” and keep Guantanamo open, then stop complaining that Israel incarcerates their domestic terrorists.</p>
