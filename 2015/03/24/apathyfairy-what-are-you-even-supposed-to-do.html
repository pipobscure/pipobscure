  <p>what are you even supposed to do when you’re standing in line at the bank like i get super awkward and try to look like im really interested in all the home equity posters and loans but it probably just looks like i’m casing the place to rob it later</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whatever you do a robbery is being prepared:</p>

<p>Version 1:<br />
You look around casing the joint to later rob it. You are preparing a robbery.</p>

<p>Version 2:<br />
You look around at the posters. The bank is preparing to rob you.</p>

<p>Whatever you do. A robbery WILL HAPPEN!</p>
